            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Lesbian and Gay Task Force was a human rights advocacy
                    organization focused on law, public policy, and the development of public
                    education and mass media. Founded in 1978, the Task Force supported the rights
                    of all oppressed minorities, with a particular focus on the civil and human
                    rights of gay men and lesbian women and transgendered and/or bisexual people.
