            <bioghist>
                <p>John Burnett Payne was born on Feb. 10, 1919, in University Park, New Mexico but
                    he was educated in the Midwest at Translyvania University and Univ. of
                    Cincinnati during the 1930s. In 1951 Payne moved to Manhattan where he began to
                    teach at Pratt Institute and where he began a thirty year career in writing. In
                    addition to teaching, during the 1960s Payne worked as a reader for several
                    publishers, including Avon Books. During the 1970s Payne published two
                    chapbooks: Tell Me That You Love Me, Con Edison, and Ghosts Scare Tito Rosa. His
                    poetry has appeared in numerous small magazines such as Kauri, Open Places,
                    Gyro, and Premiere. Payne was also a contributor to Current Biography and Yale
                    Quarterly Review. </p>
