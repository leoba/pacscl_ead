            <bioghist>
                <p>Mazie Beatrice Hall (1902-2006) was a community leader and educator. She lived in
                    Wayne, Pennsylvania and taught at Powell School in Camden, New Jersey for 23
                    years. She began teaching in Trenton in 1924 at the New Lincoln School, and in
                    1935, she got a job as a substitute teacher in Camden. She was a graduate of
                    Westchester State College, where she received a teaching certificate in 1924.
                    She was a member of the Eta chapter of the Phi Delta Kappa sorority. She was a
                    member of the National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women
                    Club, and served as the president of the Main Line chapter. She was a member of
                    the Second Baptist Church in Wayne, and in the 1970s, she was secretary of the
                    Pulpit Committee, and was involved in the selection of a new pastor for the
                    church.</p>

                <p>This collection of papers of Mazie Beatrice Hall comprises magazines, programs
                    and pamphlets, correspondence, and artifacts. Magazines collected by Hall
                    include: Ebony (1960s-1980s), Essence, Black Enterprise, American Visions, Jet,
                    Negro History Bulletin, and Crisis, a Record of the Darker Races (1919-1920 and
                    1950-1969). There are a number of programs and schedules for meetings of the
                    National Association of Negro Business and Professional Women's Club (NANBPW)
                    and the Phi Delta Kappa sorority; funeral announcements and memorial pamphlets;
                    and a memorial booklet honoring Hall's "75 years of service" to her church.
                    The correspondence in the collection largely consists of seasonal and birthday
                    greeting cards and thank you notes. There is a small amount of personal
                    correspondence from family, friends, and students, and some letters related to
                    Hall's involvement with the NANBPW and to the selection of a new pastor for her
                    church. Artifacts include clothing, shoes, hats, purses, and a banner for the
                    NANBPW. The collection also includes a small number of photographs of Hall and
                    others, two college notebooks; newspaper clippings on topics related to civil
                    rights, education, and local Wayne news; several books; calendars; sheet music;
                    and a commonplace book.</p>
