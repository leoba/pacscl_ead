            <bioghist>
                <p>West Mt. Airy Neighbors is a Pennsylvania non-profit organization that was
                    founded in 1959 to create and sustain West Mt. Airy as a racially integrated
                    community. It was founded by George Schermer, the first Director of
                    Philadelphiaâ€™s Human Relations Commission, and other neighbors concerned about
                    white flight and block busting. Committees of the Associaton work on issues of
                    concern to the community, including planning, city services, community
                    relations, and housing. The current boundaries of the organization's service
                    area are Fairmount Park on the West, Cresheim Valley Road on the North, Johnson
                    Street on the South, and Germantown Avenue of the East.</p>
