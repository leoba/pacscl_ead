            <bioghist>
                <p>The Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection is one of the nation's leading
                    research facilities for the study of the history and culture of people of
                    African descent. The core collection was donated to Temple University in 1983 by
                    Charles L. Blockson, a Pennsylvania bibliophile and collector of Afro-Americana.
                    As a major research facility, it provides materials, expository programs and
                    service for Black Studies research scholars. The collection is used by a wide
                    spectrum of researchers ranging from high school students to well-established
                    scholars. Located in Sullivan Hall on the main campus of Temple University, this
                    collection of over 30,000 items has materials on the global black experience in
                    all formats: books, manuscripts, pamphlets, journals, broadsides, posters,
                    photographs, and rare ephemera.</p>
