            <bioghist>
                <p>Elisabeth Wintersteen Schneider came to Temple University in 1926 to teach
                    English. After retiring from Temple in 1964 Schneider spent an additional six
                    years at UC Santa Barbara. Schneider wrote and edited nine books during her
                    academic career about the Romantic period in English literature and modern
                    poetry. In 1963 the English College Association chose Schneider as its
                    president.</p>
