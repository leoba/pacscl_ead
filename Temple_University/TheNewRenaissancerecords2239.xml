                <p>The New Renaissance (tnr) is an independent, unsponsored, eclectic literary
                    magazine published in Arlington, Massachusetts. It was initially conceived in
                    1966 by Louise T. Reynolds and Sylvia Shirley. After Shirley's death, Louise's
                    mother, Louise E. Reynolds, joined her in establishing the magazine. The first
                    issue appeared in the fall of 1968. According to the magazine's website, each
                    issue features a lead article on a political or sociological topic, written by
                    an professional writer or expert in the field, often with accompanying black
                    &amp; white photographs; a diverse mix of fiction, with one or two bilingual
                    stories in each volume; poetry in a variety of styles, tones, and visions,
                    including bilingual poems in every issue; reproductions of paintings, drawings,
                    lithographs, sculptures, etchings, etc., ranging from abstraction expression to
                    surrealism; essays (or essay/reviews) on topics from art to science; reviews of
                    small or university press books, and, occasionally, cartoons.</p>
