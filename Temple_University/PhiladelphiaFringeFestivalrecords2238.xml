            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Fringe Festival was founded in 1997 by Nick Stuccio, a former
                    corps member of Pennsylvania Ballet and independent arts producer, and Eric
                    Schoefer, a choreographer and performance artist. The first Festival took place
                    in September of 1997 and featured 60 performance groups. The Philadelphia Live
                    Arts Festival and Philly Fringe currently present sixteen days of performing
                    arts events each year, beginning on the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>
