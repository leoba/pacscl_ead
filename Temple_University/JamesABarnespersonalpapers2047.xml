            <bioghist>
                <p>James A. Barnes (1898-1980) was a prominent American historian who pioneered the
                    technique of microfilming primary source materials for historical research.
                    Barnes began his professional career as a fellow at the Brookings Institute
                    during the late 1920s. Between 1930 and 1966 Barnes taught history at Temple
                    University and after retirement from academia, served as president of the
                    Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Barnes' most prominent monographs were the
                    Wealth of the American People (1949) and John G. Carlisle: Financial Statesman
                    (1931).</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The papers of this prominent American economic historian include correspondence,
                    manuscripts, tear-sheets, pamphlets, handbills, clippings, photographs,
                    speeches. book reviews, invitations, and over 400 rolls of microfilm documenting
                    his source materials for monographs he wrote and approximately 9 rolls of film
                    from the National Archives. There are two hollingers of photoprints of source
                    documents and a number of transcriptions of these documents. the collection also
                    includes a small number of letters of John G. Carlisle, including a number of
                    letters of recommendation for his nomination to the Supreme Court. Barnes'
                    correspondents include historians Lawrence H. Gipson and Allan Nevins. A good
                    deal of the materials document the historian's research interests, agrarian
                    unrest in early 20th century, the American economy, and World War II. The
                    collection includes manuscripts for Barnes' four major monographs and numerous
                    journal articles. (Literary rights are held by Doris T. Barnes.) The collection
                    also includes pages from a scrapbook of clippings, photographs, and ephemera
                    compiled by Doris T. Barnes during her studies at Temple University.</p>
