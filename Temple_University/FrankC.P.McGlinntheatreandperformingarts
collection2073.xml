            <bioghist>
                <p>Born in 1914, Francis C. P. McGlinn graduated from William Penn Charter School in
                    1933, the University of North Carolina in 1937, and the University of
                    Pennsylvania Law School in 1940. He served in the military during World War II,
                    receiving a Purple Heart when he was injured in 1944. After the war, he worked
                    at the law firm of Pepper, Bodine, Stokes and Hamilton and Sheetz. He left the
                    practice of law to work as an executive for the Al Paul Lefton Co., an
                    advertising firm, from 1953-1957. Following his tenure at the Lefton Company,
                    McGlinn worked as an officer at The Fidelity Bank where he eventually became
                    executive vice president (1971-1978). McGlinn left The Fidelity Bank for the
                    Western Savings Bank where he served as vice president (1978-1980) and senior
                    vice president (1980-1982). A Republican since 1932, McGlinn excelled as a
                    fund-raiser and a financial adviser for the state and national Republican Party.
                    McGlinn also served on the board of trustees of Temple University (1954-1971),
                    the board of trustees of the Free Library of Philadelphia, and other civic and
                    philanthropic organizations. McGlinn was an aficionado of the theater and
                    collected materials on actors, acting families, and theaters. He was connected
                    for many years with the Walnut Street Theatre and the Actors' Fund of
                    America.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of theatrical materials assembled by Frank McGlinn. The bulk
                    of the collection is made up of playbills, scrapbooks, and magazines. The
                    playbills date from the middle to the end of the twentieth century and are
                    primarily from theaters in Philadelphia, New York, Washington DC, and
                    Connecticut. Scrapbooks include those compiled by McGlinn on a variety of stage
                    and screen actors and acting families; on theatrical subjects, such as Jewish
                    theater and African Americans in theater; and on a wide variety of other
                    performing arts subjects, such as the Academy of Music, opera, and the Beatles.
                    Other scrapbooks in the collection are those collected by McGlinn, including
                    "theater record" books which document the theater attendance of Beatrice A.
                    Wilson and others, and scrapbooks of clippings, photographs, playbills, and
                    ticket stubs, dating from the early twentieth century. Magazines in the
                    collection include Variety, Theater Week, Marquee, Show, Film Bulletin, and
                    Cinema. The collection also includes a number of newspaper clippings, posters,
                    photographs, etchings and engravings, sheet music and librettos, souvenir
                    programs and books, and vinyl records. Of note are the materials that document
                    specific theaters, many of them located in Philadelphia. These materials include
                    clippings, interior and exterior photos of theater buildings, and season
                    programs of local, national, and foreign theaters. Materials specifically
                    related to the Walnut Street Theater include playbills, photos, and clippings,
                    as well as minutes, memos, and planning documents from McGlinn's time on the
                    theater's board of directors, draft copies of a history of the theater by Esther
                    M. Klein, entitled "Raising the Curtain," and a chronology of the theater
                    compiled by Alice A. McGlinn in 1972.</p>
