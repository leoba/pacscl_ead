            <bioghist>
                <p>The Committee of Seventy was founded on December 7, 1904, by Philadelphia civic
                    and business leaders. The non-partisan organization's goals were to prevent
                    election fraud, improve municipal government, and to educate the public in civic
                    and political matters. The organization actively participated in elections,
                    registrations, the State Legislature as it affects Philadelphia, city finances,
                    civil service, taxation, housing, and the city charter. In the last few decades,
                    the Committee of Seventy has focused primarily on monitoring Election Day
                    activities.</p>

                <p>The collection consists of subject files of the Committee of Seventy, dating from
                    1970 to 2000. These files contain some correspondence, memos and email, notably
                    of Frederick L. Voigt, the Executive Secretary and later Executive Director of
                    the Committee of Seventy. Subject files include: newspaper articles; copies of
                    legislation and legal decisions; reports and studies; newsletters; and a small
                    amount of correspondence. Topics cover a wide range of governance issues in the
                    city of Philadelphia, such as voting, campaign finance, local and state
                    political figures, city personnel, city services, policing, planning and
                    development, finance and taxation, schools, unions, hospitals, and
                    transportation. More specific topics include voting machines, privatization of
                    city services, civil service commission, taxation governance, personnel
                    governance, and the Redevelopment Authority.</p>
