            <bioghist>
                <p>The Liberation News Service, an alternative news agency, began in 1967 as The New
                    Media Project staffed by a cooperative of a dozen political activists in
                    Washington, D.C. In 1968 a schism within the group resulted in the core staff
                    moving operations to New York, led by founders Raymond Mungo and Allen Bloom.
                    The organization originally published a packet of news information twice weekly
                    which was sent to subscribers throughout the United States and world up until
                    the organization's demise in 1980. The goal of the organization was to provide
                    an alternative to the mainstream news services, UPI and AP, by documenting
                    social and political change and activism.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This archives of a 1960s-1970s alternative news organization includes corporate
                    bylaws and financial records, correspondence, press releases, audio tapes,
                    photographs, pamphlets, news articles, microfilm, mailing lists, and clippings.
                    This collection documents a wide range of subjects of interest to the
                    cooperative media group such a Third World politics and the American social and
                    poltical protest movement associated with issues such as civil rights, energy
                    policy, public health, sexism, senior citizens, the Vietnam War, women's rights,
                    racism, prisoners' rights, peace and nuclear energy. Collection correspondence
                    documents an ongoing investigation of the organization by the F.B.I., the
                    Department of Justice, and the Internal Revenue Service. The collection also
                    contains extensive documentation of the organization's revenues, expenditures,
                    and fundraising activities. Some of these corporate records for the period
                    1976-1980 are missing. There are extensive files on the subjects of interest and
                    articles submitted by correspondents around the world, particularly from the
                    emerging socialist movements in Latin America and Africa. The extensive
                    collection of audio tapes are from two alternative news radio programs, The Rest
                    of the News and Radio Free People, emanating from Cornell University. There is a
                    small amount of administrative documentation for the Rest of the News and Radio
                    Free People, including catalogs of programs, mailing lists, and fundraising
                    information. The collection contains numerous examples of the news packets
                    distributed to over 500 subscribers nationwide including stories, photographs,
                    and graphics. The primary correspondents are Liberation News Service staffers;
                    Laura Miller, Raymond Mungo, Sandy Shea, and Allen Young. The first several
                    years of the organization archives can be found in the Marshall Bloom Collection
                    at Amherst University. </p>
