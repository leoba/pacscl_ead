                <p>Founded in 1829, the Philadelphia Inquirer is the third oldest surviving daily
                    newspaper in the United States.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection is comprised of negatives and photographs from the Philadelphia
                    Inquirer, 1920-2002. The bulk of the collection consists of daily files of
                    negatives. Most include information about the photographer and subject; some
                    have caption cards. There are some glass plate negatives, primarily from the
                    1930s and 1940s, some undated, as well as a small section of prints and contact
                    sheets arranged alphabetically by subject. The collection also includes
                    photographer assignment books covering the period 1937 to 1971. The books
                    document daily assignments, including photographer and subject. In addition,
                    there is an index file of photographers (listing photos taken) from 1977 to
                    1985. There is presently no index to the negatives.</p>
