                <p>Sue Frank, also known as Admiral Kishin, is the publisher of several Star
                    Trek-related fan zines, including "Agonizer," "Klin-fire," and
                    "KomereXXX." </p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of Star Trek fan newsletters, zines, concordances, and other
                    printed matter assembled by Sue Frank. Many of the materials were created by
                    Klingon fan groups. The collection includes newsletters from many groups in the
                    United States, and also international clubs (Italy, Great Britain, New Zealand,
                    and other locations). The titles include: "Galactic Engineers Concordance
                    Logbook"; "Mindscanners" and "Force Recon," newsletters of the Klingon
                    Assault Group; "Ho1QeD," the journal of the Klingon Language Institute; and
                    "Engage!" The collection also includes a copy of the Trekker Cookbook, a small
                    amount of ephemera from Star Trek conventions, issues of zines on non-Star Trek
                    topics, and correspondence between Frank and members of various fan groups.</p>
