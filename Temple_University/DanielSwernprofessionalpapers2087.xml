                <p>Daniel Swern was a chemist of world renown in the area of polymers and organic
                    synthesis, credited with devising a process for using oxidized soybean oil to
                    alter the texture and flexibility of vinyl. Swern came to Temple University in
                    1963 from the Fels Research Institute and a long tenure with the U.S. Dept. of
                    Agriculture, where he turned his attention to basic cancer research. Dr. Swern
                    received numerous awards during his distinguished career, including the Arthur
                    S. Flemming Award for government service in 1955 and the American Chemical
                    Society Award in 1963.</p>
