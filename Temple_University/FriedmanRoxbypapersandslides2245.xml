            <bioghist>
                <p>Reuben Friedman (1892-1956) was a professor of clinical dermatology at Temple
                    University School of Medicine and the author of several volumes on scabies and A
                    History of Dermatology in Philadelphia. John B. Roxby (1872-1957) was probably a
                    dermatologist.</p>

                <p>The collection contains notes, slides, and other materials that belonged to
                    Reuben Friedman and John B. Roxby. Glass slides relate to lectures on
                    dermatology, particularly scabies; they include images of patients, microscopic
                    view of organisms, and text, such as quotes from Italian sources. The collection
                    also includes college class and clinic notes of Reuben Friedman and John B.
                    Roxby. There are several published volumes by Friedman, as well as a framed
                    certificate, poem, and photograph.</p>
