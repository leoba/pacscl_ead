            <bioghist>
                <p>The Other Economic Summit was founded by TOES/UK, now the New Economics
                    Foundation. The first TOES conference was held in England in 1984 when a variety
                    of individuals and groups concerned with social justice and the environment
                    decided there should be a peoples' response to the G7 (now G8) summit held in
                    London that year. Ever since that time, TOES has contributed, in one way or
                    another, to Peoples' Summits held in all the G8 countries. TOES brings together
                    academics and activists from both industrialized and third-world nations.</p>
