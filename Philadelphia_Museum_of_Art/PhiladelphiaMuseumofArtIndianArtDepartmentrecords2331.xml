            <bioghist>
                <p>In 1931 the Museum appointed W. Norman Brown (1892-1975) as its first curator of
                    Indian art. Brown, who would establish the first academic department of South
                    Asian Studies in the United States in 1947, was at this time also serving as
                    chair of Sanskrit at the University of Pennsylvania. At the time of his
                    curatorial appointment, the Indian Art office was part of the Division of
                    Eastern Art. In 1954, Museum Director Fiske Kimball persuaded Dr. Stella
                    Kramrisch (1896-1993) to join the Museum and assume the curatorial position.
                    Like her predecessor, Kramrisch was a faculty member of South Asian Studies at
                    Penn. Both scholars also lived and taught in India before assuming their
                    stateside academic and curatorial positions. Kramrisch greatly expanded the
                    Museum's holdings in Indian and Himalayan art. In addition to her many scholarly
                    writings, she also curated some of the most significant exhibitions in her
                    field, such as the 1968 "Unknown India," which was the first scholarly survey
                    of Indian folk and tribal art to be presented in the western world. During
                    Kramrisch's tenure, the formal designation of her department was also modified.
                    In 1956 the Museum renamed the division "Oriental Art," with curators in
                    Indian and Far Eastern art. In 1972, it dropped the divisional title, and
                    separately recognized the two curatorial offices. The following year, Kramrisch,
                    who by then was also teaching at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York
                    University, became Curator Emeritus and Research Fellow at the Museum. She
                    continued to serve solely as Curator Emeritus from 1978 until her death in 1993.
                    In addition to bequesting her personal art collection to the Museum, Kramrisch
                    also endowed the curatorial chair of the department to which she had devoted
                    nearly 40 years of scholarship and service. In the Museum's 1995 annual report,
                    the department was listed for the first time as Indian and Himalayan Art, which
                    remains its current title, and Kramrisch's former position became the Stella
                    Kramrisch Curator. Darielle Mason was the first to receive that appointment in
                    1997 and continues to serve as curator. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This record group consists primarily of general correspondence and exhibition
                    records that document the department's activities during most of Stella
                    Kramrisch's curatorial tenure. Correspondence is alphabetically arranged by name
                    of individual or institution, as well as a few files identified by subjects,
                    such as scroll painting, lectures, and projects. Institutional correspondents
                    include museums, galleries, universities, publishers and organizations dedicated
                    to the promotion of Asian studies. Examples of the latter include the non-profit
                    American Council of Southern Asia Art (ACSAA) and the American Institute of
                    Indian Studies (AIIS), which is a consortium of universities and colleges that
                    promotes teaching and research about India. The most extensively documented
                    exhibition is "Manifestations of Shiva," which was mounted in 1981. The 13
                    linear feet of records include a subseries of general files, which are topically
                    arranged and document issues such as budget, travel, openings, publicity, and
                    related symposium. The many "history" files that are a subgroup to the general
                    files appear to pertain to the initial work, research and contacts made in
                    preparing for the exhibition. The second subseries consists of lender files,
                    which are grouped by location, namely American, European and Indian, and within
                    each georgraphic division, by type of lender, either private or institution. The
                    exhibition catalogue is the third subseries, and documentation consists
                    primarily of catalogue entries and photographs of each object, as well as
                    research material. Most of the material comprising the "Other subjects" series
                    pertains to a biographical project about Kramrisch undertaken after her death by
                    the department's curatorial and administrative assistant, Nancy Baxter. These
                    files include genealogical research, family histories, and correspondence
                    between Baxter and Kramrisch family members, Kramrisch chronology, Kramrisch
                    bibliography, Kramrisch personal correspondence, papers from her apartment and
                    legal papers. There are also sets of files regarding the return of incoming
                    loans, refused exhibition loan requests, and general research and reference
                    material, as well as a small amount of insurance requests, Museum publications
                    and information to certain gallery installations. One of the items in regard to
                    the latter is also a piece of memorabilia--sheet music of the song played at the
                    dedication of the Museum's Indian Temple in 1920. Langdon Warner, the Museum's
                    director at that time, wrote the lyrics.</p>
