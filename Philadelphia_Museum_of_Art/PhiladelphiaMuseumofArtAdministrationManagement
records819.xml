            <bioghist>
                <p>Under Eugene W. Kuthy, the Associate Director for Museum Management from February
                    1982 until December 1982, the Department had responsibility for Finance and
                    Control, Personnel, Marketing, Building Operations and Membership. Kuthy also
                    served as liaison between city and state governments and PMA.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of records of the Administration/Management department. This
                    department's records include "day files" of Eugene Kuthy, which consist
                    primarily of his outgoing correspondence, from February to December 1982,
                    arranged chronologically. There are also records from several exhibitions that
                    opened or were being organized during Kuthy's tenure, including, "The
                    Pennsylvania Germans," "Treasures of Ancient Nigeria," and shows of the works
                    of Landseer and Eakins. Subject files include topics such as lobbying, other
                    Philadelphia cultural institutions, and museum committees. The collection also
                    includes memos and correspondence from Kuthy, and copies of memos and
                    correspondence from other offices. </p>
