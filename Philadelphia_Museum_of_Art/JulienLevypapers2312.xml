            <bioghist>
                <p>Julien Levy (1906-1981) was a pioneering New York art dealer of the 1930s and
                    1940s. Levy was introduced to the art world in Paris by Marcel Duchamp, whom he
                    had met in New York in 1926. In Paris he met photographers and artists,
                    including Man Ray, Berenice Abbot, and Joella Haweis, daughter of Dadaist muse
                    Mina Loy, who became his wife. Upon his return to the United States, Levy worked
                    briefly at the Weyhe Gallery before opening the Julien Levy Gallery at 602
                    Madison Avenue. In 1937 he moved the gallery to 15 East 57th Street, and in 1943
                    he relocated again to 42 East 57th. This was the location of the gallery until
                    it closed in 1949. In the beginning of his career, Levy exhibited and sold the
                    work of American and European photographers, including Atget, Stieglitz, Nadar,
                    Henri Cartier-Bresson. In 1932 Levy held the first Surrealism show in New York,
                    displaying works from a variety of mediums, including photography, painting,
                    sculpture, collage, and books. This show introduced major artists of the
                    Surrealist movement, most notably Salvador Dali, whose painting “The Persistence
                    of Memory” Levy had purchased the previous year. In addition to promoting Dali’s
                    work, Levy was the first New York dealer to show the works of many important
                    Surrealist-influenced artists, including Joseph Cornell, Frida Kahlo, and
                    Arshile Gorky.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection of correspondence, scrapbooks, ledgers, gallery and exhibition
                    catalogs, diaries and appointment calendars documents the work of the Julien
                    Levy Gallery and the relationships between Julien Levy and the artists with whom
                    he worked. The bulk of the collection consists of Levy’s correspondence with
                    artists, other art dealers, museums, and schools, dating from 1919 to 1983. In
                    addition to incoming and outgoing letters, the correspondence files include
                    photographs, inventories of paintings at Levy's gallery, lists of works in
                    shows, announcements and catalogues, and invoices and receipts. Notable
                    correspondents include Salvador Dali, Marcel Duchamp, Man Ray, Max Ernst, Joseph
                    Cornell, Andre Breton, Eugene Berman, Alexander Calder, Arshile Gorky, and many
                    others. The correspondence files also include a small batch of family letters,
                    including letters from Levy's mother Isabell Isaacs Levy to his father and
                    Isaacs family letters from the late nineteenth century. At the end of the
                    correspondence section are correspondence and publicity materials related to the
                    publication of Levy’s Memoir Of An Art Gallery; inventories of the Levy Gallery;
                    mailing lists; blueprints; stock certificates; press releases; and miscellaneous
                    financial records 1930s-1960s. Two ledgers document the inventory at the Julien
                    Levy Gallery from 1931 to 1961; one is a sales ledger covering the period 1942
                    to 1949 and the other is a ledger of individual artist’s accounts, 1940s. The
                    collection includes a substantial number of announcements and gallery and
                    exhibition catalogs for shows of painting, photography, and sculpture at the
                    Julien Levy Gallery, 1932-1949. These items include materials from shows of
                    Dali, Ernst, Gorky, Berman, Atget, Cornell, Tchelitchew, and many others.
                    Appointment calendars, dating from 1948 to 1981 document Julien Levy’s daily
                    activities beginning in 1948, shortly before he closed his gallery, and
                    continuing until 1981. Two diaries that Levy kept from 1957 to 1959 offer a more
                    personal view of his life. There is also a very brief diary kept by Jean Levy in
                    1957. The history of the Gallery and Julien Levy’s own range of interests can be
                    traced through scrapbooks kept by Levy. These scrapbooks include newspaper and
                    magazine clippings on the gallery and on artists with whom Levy worked; press
                    releases of the Gallery; announcements and other publicity materials about the
                    Gallery; and clippings of stories on a variety of cultural topics of interest to
                    Levy.</p>
