            <bioghist>
                <p>Anne d'Harnoncourt (1944-2008) headed the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) as the
                    George D. Widener Director from 1982 to 2008, adding the position of CEO in
                    1997. At the time of the latter appointment, d'Harnoncourt, then 53, was the
                    only woman in America directing a museum with a budget of more than $25 million,
                    making her, according to the New York Times, one of the most powerful women in
                    the American art world. Under her directorship, the Museum has attracted a
                    growing public audience through major "blockbuster" exhibitions and
                    publications, and she has been credited with building a distinguished
                    professional staff. Under her directorship, significant gallery renovations have
                    been made, encompassing the 90 European art galleries and 20 galleries of modern
                    and contemporary art. The changes to the European spaces also afforded the
                    opportunity to reexamine, conserve and present in new ways thousands of objects
                    in the collection. Under d'Harnoncourt's directorship, the Museum has also
                    committed itself to the most ambitious expansion and renovation program in its
                    more than 125-year history. Launched in 1999, this ten-year, $500 million
                    capital plan includes increasing the Museum’s public space by sixty percent.
                    Another significant goal of the program was realized in 2007 with the opening of
                    the Perelman Building, a renovated Art Deco facility that offers additional
                    gallery and office spaces across the street from the Museum’s iconic
                    Neoclassical building. D'Harnoncourt's indelible association with the Museum
                    began in 1967 when she worked for two years as a curatorial assistant in the
                    Department of Painting and Sculpture. She spent the next two years as an
                    Assistant Curator of Twentieth Century Art at the Art Institute of Chicago. In
                    1971 d'Harnoncourt returned to PMA as Associate Curator of Twentieth Century
                    Art, becoming full Curator the following year. At this time, d'Harnoncourt's
                    reputation as an expert on the art of Marcel Duchamp was truly taking form. In
                    1972 she organized a major retrospective of his work, which also traveled to the
                    Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Art Institute of Chicago. During her
                    curatorial tenure at PMA, she championed the Museum's commitment to strengthen
                    its contemporary art holdings, bringing in major works by Jasper Johns, Brice
                    Marden, Ellsworth Kelly, Sol LeWitt and other important modern and contemporary
                    artists. D'Harnoncourt's ties to the Museum are also personal. Her husband is
                    Joseph Rishel, the Museum's Gisela and Dennis Alter Senior Curator of Euopean
                    Painting before 1900 and Senior Curator of the John G. Johnson Collection and
                    the Rodin Museum. They met while working at the Art Institute of Chicago, and
                    married in 1971. Born in Washington D.C, d'Harnoncourt was raised in New York
                    City, attending the Brearley School from 1949 to 1961. Her training in art
                    history and museum studies came formally and informally. Her father, the
                    distinguished art historian René d'Harnoncourt, served as director of the Museum
                    of Modern Art in New York from 1949 until shortly before his death in 1968. His
                    years there allowed d'Harnoncourt, as she describes, time for "scampering down
                    the halls of the Museum…as a child." According to d'Harnoncourt, however, the
                    more significant influence was her father's "enormous love of art and artists.
                    He had a great respect and love for the art of installation." His circle of
                    acquaintances also brought his daughter in contact with some of contemporary
                    art's key figures, such as Jasper Johns and Mark Rothko. Her parents also knew
                    Marcel Duchamp. Despite the early exposure, d'Harnoncourt never considered a
                    museum career as a child; instead, she has said that she envisioned herself as
                    an actress, or in government. She changed her mind after college. Upon
                    graduating magna cum laude from Radcliffe College with a degree in history and
                    literature, d'Harnoncourt attended London's Courtauld Institute, an experience
                    she attributes as giving her "a marvelous kind of immersion in the history of
                    art." In preparing her thesis, which examined the moral subject matter of 19th
                    century British painting, particularly the art of the Pre-Raphaelites,
                    d'Harnoncourt worked six months at the Tate Gallery, London. She received an
                    M.A. with distinction from the Institute in 1967. Among d'Harnoncourt's writings
                    are articles on 20th century artists and collectors of modern art for various
                    journals, including the Museum’s 1969 Bulletin, which was devoted entirely to
                    the 52-page essay she co-wrote with Walter Hopps about Duchamp's mixed-media
                    assemblage, Etant Donnés. She also edited the 1973 publication, "Marcel
                    Duchamp," wrote parts of the catalogue to the 1972-1973 exhibition, and
                    contributed essays to the 1980 exhibition catalogue, "Futurism and the
                    international avant-garde." Since becoming Director, d'Harnoncourt has written
                    introductions and forewords to many of the Museum's publications. D'Harnoncourt
                    has served on a number of panels, boards and committees at various times,
                    including the J. Paul Getty Museum, the John Cage Trust, ARTstor, the Japan
                    Society, the Henry Luce Foundation, Inc., University of Pennsylvania School of
                    Design, the Fairmount Park Art Association, the Fabric Workshop and Museum, the
                    Philadelphia Award, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Smithsonian
                    Institution, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. She is a member of
                    the Association of Art Museum Directors and of the American Philosophical
                    Society, the country’s first learned society established by Benjamin Franklin in
                    Philadelphia. She has received several citations and awards for herself and on
                    behalf of the Museum from the City of Philadelphia and the State of
                    Pennsylvania. The Republic of France has twice honored d'Harnoncourt, appointing
                    her Chevalier and then Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1995 and
                    2002, respectively. In 1997 d'Harnoncourt received the Philadelphia Award.
                    Almost half a century earlier that same honor went to another of the Museum's
                    directors, Fiske Kimball, whose 25-year tenure and legacy at the Museum
                    d'Harnoncourt now rivals. In 2001, the Historical Society of Pennsylvania
                    selected her for its Founder's Award for Exemplary Service to History, and in
                    2005 she received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Princeton University.
                    In 2007 the President of Mexico awarded her the decoration of the Mexican Order
                    of the Aztec Eagle. D'Harnoncourt's parents married in 1933 in Chicago. She was
                    their only child. Her mother, Sarah Carr d'Harnoncourt, died in 2001.</p>

                <p>More than half of these records (55 linear feet) consist of alphabetically
                    arranged correspondence and subject files for the years 1982-2002, and thus
                    begin approximately with d'Harnoncourt's appointment as Director. Currently,
                    these files are subdivided by date spans of one to six years, with some subgroup
                    dates overlapping. The 1995-1998 set is further divided into three subsets:
                    alphabetical correspondence, departmental, and subject files. In the other sets,
                    these records are interfiled in one alphabetical run. Exhibition records
                    comprise another significant group, totaling 35 linear feet, dating from 1978 to
                    2006. The records begin with the 1982 exhibition, "Thomas Eakins: Artist of
                    Philadelphia." To date, the latest exhibition documented is "Looking at
                    Atget," which was held in 2005. The show featured the works of the French
                    photographer Eugène Atget, who began his career in the early 1890s. Other
                    separate filing groups pertain to d'Harnoncourt's affiliation with other
                    organizations and to the Board of Trustees of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
                    Garden, which she joined in 1974. Measuring 1.3 linear feet, the former set of
                    files is dated 1974-1980 and thus documents d'Harnoncourt's professional
                    affiliations prior to her appointment as director. Records comprising the latter
                    set are dated 1982-1986, and measure approximately 2.5 linear feet. Both sets of
                    files were part of the first group of d'Harnoncourt's director's records (9
                    linear feet of records) accessioned by the Museum's Archives. Also of note is
                    the set of files documenting the Museum's accreditation by the American
                    Association of Museums (AAM). The material dates from 1999 and measures
                    approximately 1.3 linear feet. The accreditation is a significant achievement
                    for a museum in the United States. According to AAM, this "seal of approval"
                    gives national recognition to an instiution's "commitment to excellence,
                    accountability, high professional standards, and continued institutional
                    improvement."</p>
