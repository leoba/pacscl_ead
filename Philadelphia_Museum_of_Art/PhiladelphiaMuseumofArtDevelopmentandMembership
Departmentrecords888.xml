            <bioghist>
                <p>In addition to cultivating and soliciting donors and other funding sources, a
                    development office establishes the suitability between such funding and an
                    institution's strategic planning. Over the Museum's history, the responsibility
                    for a development program has fluctuated between corporate officers, committees,
                    and personnel from various offices, departments and divisions of operation. At
                    times, one director or manager has been assigned to administer both a
                    development and membership program. There have also been periods when public
                    relations and publicity have been joined to the duties of fundraising.
                    Membership was originally the concern of the Secretary of the Corporation. At
                    the turn of the century, the Associate Committee of Women was active in
                    membership and fund drives. From the late 1920s to early 1940s, under the
                    directorship of Fiske Kimball, private firms were hired to perform such
                    services, with one employee working on site. Julius Zieget, who was the Museum's
                    corporate Secretary and Treasurer, also worked with Kimball on Museum
                    development. Another officer at that time, J. Stogdell Stokes, chaired the
                    Museum Fund Committee, which had its own office in the city, separate from the
                    museum building. The earliest Museum Fund Campaigns, initiated in the late
                    1920s, were also conducted by the outside firms hired by Kimball and the Board
                    of Trustees, and charged with raising funds for Museum construction and for
                    financing the purchase of significant collections. During most of the 1950s, an
                    Administration staff member handled membership and also served as press
                    representative. Soon after, those duties were split. In the 1964-1965 Annual
                    Report, a Museum staff person was listed for the first time in connection with
                    the Fund Office. Madeleine S. de Miège, who was secretary to the Museum
                    President, also served as Fund Office Secretary and Assistant. In 1967, the
                    Museum hired Robert Safrin as its first Manager of the Development and
                    Membership departments. Other than a Membership Secretary, Safrin was the sole
                    staffer of these departments. His position was listed as part of the Museum's
                    Administration division. Both Safrin and de Miège held their positions through
                    1971. The following year appears to have been a turning point in the way the
                    Museum intended to cultivate its development and membership programs. As noted
                    in the 1970-1971 Annual Report (which included a list of staff as of April
                    1972), a Development and Membership Department, separate from Administration,
                    was listed. Noble Smith was the department's Acting Manager, overseeing Jane
                    Custer, membership supervisor, and Cathey McClain, annual fund-giving
                    coordinator. A Development Steering Committee was also initiated that year. The
                    next year, Development and Membership became separate departments, each
                    operating with the same staff positions of annual giving coordinator and
                    supervisor, respectively. The management position for development, however, once
                    again became part of Administration, with the appointment of Philip Thompson as
                    Assistant Director for Development, who replaced Noble Smith. Thompson remained
                    in that position through 1977, and in 1979 Noble Smith returned to the Museum,
                    replacing his replacement. For 1980 and 1981, Smith's responsibilities expanded
                    to include membership and public relations in addition to development. During
                    the collective Administration tenures of Thompson and Smith, the designation of
                    Development and Membership departments--while separate from
                    Administration--fluctuated between individual and combined offices. From 1973 to
                    1975, Development was its own department, staffed by an annual giving
                    coordinator. Cathey F. McClain, Judith H. Renner and Ardith Talbot each held
                    that position, respectively, over those three years. For the same time period,
                    Jane Copeland and Dorothy M. Hanbury served respectively as supervisors for
                    Membership. In 1976, the offices were once again combined and Copeland was named
                    manager. In 1978, the offices were split. Copeland continued to manage
                    Development, while Thomas L Conti was given charge of Membership and Planned
                    Giving. Melanie M. Yulman was Development manager for 1979. As indicated in the
                    1980-1981 Annual Report, the Museum revised its overall staff structure, so that
                    each office and department was categorized under one of three divisions:
                    corporate, curatorial, and programs and supporting services. In 1980, Noble
                    Smith's Administration position became a Corporate one. And for the first time,
                    a director was appointed to oversee the Development Department, which was
                    classified within the latter division. Maria Giliotti assumed that position,
                    which put her in charge of staff responsible for annual giving, major gifts,
                    grants, and planned giving. Although the organizational structure of the Museum
                    would continue to fluctuate in the following decade, in 1982 the Development
                    Department, as well as Membership began operating as it does today, independent
                    of any corporate supervision.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>Most of these records document the operation of the Development Office under its
                    two Assistant Directors Philip Thompson and Noble Smith, who managed the office
                    from 1973-1977 and 1979-1981, respectively. The first series, "Fund Office
                    records" predates the establishment of a Development office. The compiler of
                    this material was Madeleine S. de Miège, who served as Fund Office Secretary,
                    and then Assistant, from 1965 to 1971. She was also secretary/assistant to the
                    Museum's president. Her records pertain to the Museum's capital fund programs
                    conducted from 1960 to 1967. The second series consists of general departmental
                    records of the Development Office, and begin in 1967 when the Museum appointed
                    Robert Safrin as its first manager of the Development and Membership Department.
                    Most of the records are arranged in chronological subseries: 1967-1971;
                    1971-1972; 1972-1973; 1973-1974; and 1977-1981. These ranges represent bulk
                    dates since the dating of much of the material overlaps. Documented activities
                    include fund raising and capital programs, state appropriations, work with the
                    Committee of Development and Membership, and the operation of the Museum gift
                    shop. Recurring subjects include "Associates," "Budget," "Corporate,"
                    "Members," and "Trustees." The last subseries, "Inactive donors," consists
                    of records compiled on an ongoing basis about individuals no longer
                    contributing, including deceased donors. The material dates from 1946 to 1989,
                    and a file-level inventory is available in the Archives. The third series
                    consists of the papers of Thompson and Smith, each comprising its own subseries.
                    The files in each are alphabetically arranged, and topics are similar to those
                    documented in the previous series. Smith's records also include photocopies of
                    his outgoing correspondence, which his office referred to as "Log/Daybook,"
                    dating from Sept. 1980 to Jan. 1982. In regard to the last series, "Noble Smith
                    working files," it appears that Smith compiled this material for general Museum
                    reference, with a few personal papers regarding travel expenses.</p>
