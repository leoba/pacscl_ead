            <bioghist>
                <p>As Museum Archivist Louise Rossmassler recalled in 1983, the Museum initiated its
                    Archives in 1975 during the installation of an air-conditioning system
                    throughout the building. "The Director, Evan Turner, recognized the opportunity
                    to gather together the scattered collections of ... records so that they would
                    be available for research use." He also took advantage of the offer of Gertrude
                    Toomey, the Museum's retired registrar, to help with the project. The following
                    year, Merle Chamberlain, who had been a volunteer in the Museum Library, was
                    appointed the Museum's first archivist, with Toomey's part-time assistance. From
                    1976 to 1977, the Archives functioned as an independent office. By 1978, it
                    became part of the Library. Before retiring in 1982, Chamberlain wrote the first
                    two editions of the Inventory of the Archives, the first publication giving
                    staff and outside researchers intellectual access to its holdings. Louise
                    Rossmassler, who succeeded Chamberlain as archivist, wrote the next two editions
                    of the inventory. Upon Rossmassler's retirement in 1987, Alice Lefton became
                    archivist. She served until 1991 when operation of the Archives was temporarily
                    suspended. Because of the volunteer service of Rossmassler, however, the
                    Archives was able to continue to operate on a limited basis. Because of
                    Rossmassler's efforts, staff and scholars could still access records and
                    continue their research. In 1998, the Museum reopened the Archives on a
                    full-time basis, appointing Susan Anderson as museum archivist. Anderson
                    continues to serve in that position. Rossmassler continues to volunteer.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>Beginning approximately in 1962, the earliest records are general files compiled
                    by the archivists over a thirty-year period. Files pertain to topics concerning
                    the Museum's operation, such as admission and membership, as well as archival
                    issues, such as preservation and the temporary closing of the Museum's Archives.
                    Reference reports of researchers visiting the Archives from 1986 to 1999
                    comprise the second record series. Chronological summaries measure in-house and
                    outside research, and a second subseries pertains to individual scholars
                    undertaking "intensive research" projects. The third and largest series
                    pertains to the archives initiative funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
                    During this four-year grant project, which began in the fall of 2000, project
                    staff worked to enhance scholarly access to several historically significant
                    manuscript collections and institutional records through an integrated program
                    of processing, database development, digitization, and encoding for Internet
                    distribution. Records are those produced by the Museum archivist, project
                    manager, project archivist and assistant project archivist. The records document
                    each stage, from planning and grant application to database development and
                    processing plans.</p>
