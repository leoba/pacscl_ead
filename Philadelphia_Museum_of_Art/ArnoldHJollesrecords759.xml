            <bioghist>
                <p>Arnold H. Jolles succeeded Michael Botwinick as Assistant Director for Art of the
                    Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1974. From 1977 to 1979 he served as Acting
                    Director of Museum, filling that role after Evan Turner left and until Jean
                    Sutherland Boggs arrived. From 1979 to 1986 he was Director of the Seattle Art
                    Museum. In 1988 he was appointed interim director of the Bellevue Art Museum and
                    later served as vice president and chief curatorial officer of the Eiteljorg
                    Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of Arnold Jolles' files from his time as Assistant Director
                    for Art, 1970-1977 and as Acting Director, 1977-1979. These records document the
                    Museum's planning for the Bicentennial, the reinstallation of the American Art
                    galleries in 1975, exhibitions, the work of several corporate and departmental
                    committees, general museum subjects, and the daily management of the Museum. The
                    Assistant Directors records are arranged into five series: general subjects;
                    curatorial and museum departments; meeting minutes, policies and grants;
                    construction records; and Exhibition, installation, and event records. Materials
                    include incoming and outgoing correspondence, minutes, memoranda, telephone logs
                    and appointment calendars. The Acting Director records are arranged into five
                    series: general correspondence; in-log and out-log files; museum subjects;
                    “Treasures of Early Irish Art” exhibition records; and "Second Empire: Art in
                    France under Napoleon III" exhibition records. Topics represented in the
                    General subjects series include: security, building maintenance and capital
                    programs, the Kienbusch collection; the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance;
                    the Bicentennial; loans and acquisitions; legal and personnel files; and damage
                    reports.</p>
