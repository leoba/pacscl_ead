            <bioghist>
                <p>Evan Turner, an art historian and scholar, was the Director of the Museum from
                    1964 to 1978; from here he went to North Carolina's Ackland Art Museum and
                    beginning in 1982, was the Director of the Cleveland Museum of Art. A dynamic
                    personality, he reorganized the staff along individual departmental lines. The
                    Kienbusch Arms and Armor Collection came to the Museum during his tenure and the
                    closing and reopening of the Museum after the completed air-conditioning also
                    took place then.</p>

                    the “inner circle” of the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD) and
                    Chairman of their Professional Practices Committee. In addition, he was on the
                    Advisory Panel of the National Council of the Arts, and the National Endowment
                    for the Arts. There are lengthy records of his activities in these fields.</p>
