            <bioghist>
                <p>George C. A. Barbour, a construction engineer for the Fairmount Museum project,
                    was appointed Superintendent of the new building at its opening in 1928. With
                    Memorial Hall's continued operation, Barbour's office was designated as
                    "Buildings" to reflect both facilities. He served as General Superintendent
                    until his retirement in 1961, at which time Alan Corson, Jr. assumed the
                    position. Robert Lipsey succeeded Corson, serving from 1969 to 1978. During
                    these tenures, the office designation changed. From 1949 to 1952, the General
                    Superintendent position was simply considered part of the administrative staff.
                    In 1953, Barbour headed "Construction and Operation," with Jane Edmiston as
                    Personnel and Budget Officer. In 1971, at the time of Lipsey's tenure, the
                    General Superintendent became a City appointment, along with the newly-created
                    position of Engineer Technician, held by Walter Cheatham. Edmiston also became a
                    City employee, with her appointment as Clerical Supervisor. The following year,
                    both positions were eliminated. Lipsey's position ended with his retirement in
                    1978.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection contains records about the physical facilities of the
                    Philadelphia Museum of Art. The materials are arranged into series by creating
                    office: records of Building Superintendents George Barbour (1946-1972), Alan
                    Corson (1962-1969), and Robert Lipsey (1968-1978); records of Engineers William
                    G. Allen (1937-1959) and Walter Cheatham (1969-1976); records of Administrative
                    Services Officer Jane Edmiston (1953-1972). The last series consists of a ledger
                    inventory of drawings under the jurisdiction of the current Manager of
                    Engineering Services. The work of the Superintendent and Engineer is closely
                    related and sometimes records are interfiled. Subjects documented by the records
                    include: architects and contractors; manufacturers; mechanical and electrical
                    systems; personnel matters; specific Museum sections, galleries, special events,
                    and exhibitions; WPA construction projects; . Files pertaining to construction
                    and maintenance include blueprints, job specifications and work orders, purchase
                    requests, contract information, product brochures. Other materials in the
                    collection are attendance reports, reports from the Park Houses, city offices
                    and special projects, personnel files, correspondence and internal memoranda,
                    and accident and damage reports. The ledger of drawings includes a catalog
                    listing of drawings in ledger, numbers 700-2459, 1937-1965; and a catalog
                    listing of drawings in notebook from Dec. 1974 to May 1975 and from May 1976.
