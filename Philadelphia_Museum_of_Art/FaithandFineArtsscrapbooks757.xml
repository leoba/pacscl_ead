            <bioghist>
                <p>Founded in 1961, Faith and Fine Arts was the inspiration of Sally Lorimer Morris
                    who, along with her mother Mrs. Graeme Lorimer and nine other women, organized a
                    program "to know our Art Museum." Each month, the group selected a section of
                    the museum to explore, accompanied by a member of the Volunteer Guides. The
                    group also attended a regular series of lectures and made visits to other
                    cultural institutions in the area. Faith and Fine Arts has also regularly
                    donated funds to the Museum's Library for the purchase of books.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>These six scrapbooks documenting the activities of Faith and Fine Arts consist
                    primarily of ephemera and clippings, along with general and annual mailings to
                    the members of Faith and Fine Arts. Brochures, invitations, and programs
                    document the various events hosted by the group, including lectures, tours, and
                    field trips. The scrapbooks include some letters to museum staff, volunteer
                    guides, and staff of other arts organizations; membership lists; photographs of
                    events; and lists of book purchases made possible by the group's gifts to the
                    library.</p>
