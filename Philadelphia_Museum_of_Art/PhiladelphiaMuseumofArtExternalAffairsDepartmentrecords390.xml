            <bioghist>
                <p>The External Affairs department grew out of the Urban Outreach department, which
                    operated between 1970 and 1977, and its successor Community Programs, which
                    operated from 1978 through 1982. In January 1983, the Museum created a new
                    Administration office, the Office of the Assistant Director for Program, and
                    recruited Cheryl McLeney-Brooker to head it. According to the 1986-1989 Annual
                    Report, by at least June 1989, McLeney-Brooker became Vice-President for
                    External Affairs, and the office name changed to reflect that title. Her staff
                    consisted of a staff writer, audio-video personnel and an executive secretary.
                    In 1998 the various vice-president offices that operated under Administration
                    became independent departments, including External Affairs. Cheryl
                    McLeney-Brooker now guided the department as its Director, with Diana
                    Myers-Bennett Roberts as Program Administrator. According to the 2006 Annual
                    Report, External Affairs now operates as an office within the Division of
                    Education. Staff consists of Andreina Castillo as Program Coordinator, in
                    addition to McLeney-Brooker as Director.</p>

                <p>These records document activities held within and outside of the Museum to
                    further the department's ongoing development and promotion of collaboration,
                    outreach, diversity and government relations. Museum activities include special
                    exhibitions, visitor services and special projects and programs. Departmental
                    papers include chronological "Day" files (1989-2001), budget files
                    (1991-2002), as well as incidental bills and invoices. Collaborative efforts and
                    organizations documented here include AIDS Walks (1992-1999); Latino Caucus
                    1993, Free Library of Philadelphia Summer Program (1999-2002), Legislative
                    luncheons, Philadelphia Folklore Project (1997-1998), Multicultural Affairs
                    Congress (1994-1998), and the Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum
                    (1992-1997),. The collection also includes records related to the Henry Ossawa
                    Tanner Tanner Exhibition, 1991, the Salgado Exhibition, 1993, and other
                    exhibits, events, and outreach programs (Philadelphia and the China Trade,
                    Puerto Rican Heritage Evening, Martin Puryear, school age programs). Many of
                    these files come from the office of Cheryl McLeney-Brooker, VP of External
                    Affairs. </p>
