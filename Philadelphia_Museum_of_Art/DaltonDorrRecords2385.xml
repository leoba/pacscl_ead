            <bioghist>
                <p>Dalton Dorr was the first Director of the Museum, appointed in 1892, 12 years
                    after the elimination of the Managing Director of the Museum and School from the
                    roster. Dorr had been Secretary since 1880 and Curator since 1887. Although he
                    never held the titles of Director, Secretary, and Curator simultaneously, he
                    presumably performed the duties of these three positions until 1899 when William
                    Platt Pepper was elected Director. Dorr continued as Secretary and Curator until
                    his death on February 26, 1901.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The incoming correspondence, mainly directed to Dorr is in the Museum Letter
                    Books; the outgoing correspondence is in the Letter Press Books. The Letter
                    Books dating from February 1876 to December 1904, contain the incoming
                    correspondence regarding the acquisitions, the collection, exhibitions, the
                    staff, Memorial Hall repairs, and the overall establishment of the Museum and
                    schools. The letters were numbered, indexed and pasted into books. Letter Press
                    Books from the Museum date from April 1876 to April 1901 and contain
                    tissue-paper copies of outgoing Museum correspondence, all indexed. The letters
                    written were dampened and pressed into a book of tissue-paper leaves which then
                    transferred an ink copy to that page. The inks used would have to have been very
                    stable to withstand this treatment and still retain enough ink on the original
                    page. Not all outgoing correspondence was so copied; routine answers to queries
                    usually were not copied. (After 1901 it would appear that carbon paper came into
                    popular usage. The typewriter first came into extensive use during the
                    1890s.)</p>
