            <bioghist>
                <p>George H. Marcus headed the Publications department beginning in 1968. During the
                    1970s and 1980s, Christine K. Ivusic and Janet Watkins served consecutively as
                    his Assistant/Senior Editors. Sherry Babbitt joined the department in 1978 as
                    secretary. Promoted over the next two decades, Babbitt succeeded Marcus in 2001
                    as Director of the department, which by then operated under its current
                    designation of "Publishing."</p>
