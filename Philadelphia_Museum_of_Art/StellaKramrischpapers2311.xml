            <bioghist>
                <p>As a teacher, lecturer, curator and writer, Stella Kramrisch (1898-1993) devoted
                    nearly 70 years to the study and appreciation of Indian art. In remembering
                    Kramrisch, Thomas Lawton, the former deputy director of the Freer Gallery of
                    Art, observed that "all students of Indian culture must acknowledge an
                    intellectual indebtedness" to Kramrisch's numerous and highly original
                    scholarly contributions. Stella Kramrisch was born May 29, 1898 in the Moravian
                    town of Nikolsburg (now Mikulov), Austria. When she was about ten years old, her
                    family moved to Vienna. Her early years of education there included Greek, Latin
                    and German philosophy, which introduced her to Indian literature. At the
                    University of Vienna, Kramrisch complimented her studies in art history with
                    courses on Sanskrit, and with the completion of her dissertation on early
                    Buddhist sculpture in India, she received her doctoral degree in 1919. That same
                    year, Kramrisch was invited to lecture at Oxford University. While in England,
                    she met the Bengali writer and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore, who was Asia's
                    first Noble laureate, having received the Noble Prize in literature in 1913. At
                    that time, Tagore was involved in establishing an international university that
                    would bring together scholars from East and West cultures. The university, which
                    is known today as Visva Bharati, was located in the town of Santiniketan in West
                    Bengal, India, and Tagore invited Kramrisch to come there to teach at Kala
                    Bhavan, the university's College of Fine Arts and Crafts. Accepting the offer,
                    Kramrisch sailed to India in 1920 and taught Indian art and a survey of Western
                    art at the college. In 1923 she left Bengal and joined the faculty at the
                    University of Calcutta, becoming its first professor of Indian Art. The
                    following year, Kramrisch published her first book, "Principles of Indian
                    Art," (translated from German), which contemporary major scholars praised
                    highly. Although Kramrisch continued to teach for the next 17 years in Calcutta,
                    she spent part of each year from 1937 to 1940 in London lecturing at the
                    Courtauld Institute. Leaving Calcutta in 1950, Kramrisch came to the United
                    States to join the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia as
                    a Professor of South Asian Art, and she continued to teach there until 1969. (It
                    is unclear whether her departure from India also may have been precipitated by
                    the assassination of her husband that same year in Pakistan). In 1954 Kramrisch
                    also took on the role of curator of Indian art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art
                    and served as such until 1972. From 1972 until her death in 1993, Kramrisch
                    oversaw the department as Curator Emeritus. Undaunted by the academic and
                    curatorial demands made of her in Philadelphia, Kramrisch also accepted an
                    appointment at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts, and taught as a
                    Professor of Indian Art from 1964 to 1982. As noted in the PMA's published
                    memorial, Kramrisch's writings were even more far-reaching as many of her books
                    continue to be used in universities around the world. During her tenure at the
                    Philadelphia Museum of Art, Kramrisch developed its holdings in Indian and
                    Himalayan art and staged a series of ambitious exhibitions that, accompanied by
                    the catalogues and related studies that she wrote, brought significant
                    recognition to the Museum and to the field of Indian art and culture. One such
                    exhibition opened in 1968. Entitled "Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and
                    Village," it showcased nearly 500 religious and secular objects. After 12 years
                    of planning, research and negotiations, another ground-breaking exhibition,
                    "Manifestations of Shiva" opened in 1981. It was the first major exhibition in
                    this country to examine the religious deity and to explore the multiple
                    interpretations of its meaning. Many of the 197 objects displayed had never
                    before left India. As to the Museum's own collection, Kramrisch oversaw
                    important acquisitions, including a 6th century bronze mask of Shiva, a bronze
                    figure of Rama made during the Chola dynasty of southern India, and "Radha and
                    Krishna," a painting by a Kishangarh school artist. Kramrisch received
                    worldwide recognition for her many achievements, including honorary degrees from
                    Visva Bharati University (1974) and from the University of Pennsylvania (1981).
                    At a ceremony held at PMA in 1979, Kramrisch was given the Austrian Cross of
                    Honor for Science and Art, and in 1985 she received the Freer Medal for her
                    contribution to the "understanding of Oriental civilization as reflected in
                    their arts." Perhaps the most telling testament of Kramrisch's life's work came
                    in 1982 when the Indian government presented her with its highest civilian honor
                    of Padma Bhushan. Kramrisch received the honor for "stimulating a renewed
                    interest not only in the artistic heritage of India but also in its underlying
                    philosophies and world view." Stella Kramrisch died on August 31, 1993, at the
                    age of 97. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>With most of the material pertaining to her research, writings and reference
                    files, the papers of Stella Kramrisch underscore her lifelong commitment to the
                    study and appreciation of Indian art. The first series, "Personal papers and
                    records," consists of two subseries that divide documentation by material type
                    and by subject. The few files of correspondence pertain primarily to a
                    fellowship and letters of recommendation. Other material types include business
                    cards, personal stationary, a rolodex file and a photograph album/scrapbook,
                    which is the most revealing item of Kramrisch's personal life and interests. The
                    album contains clippings, correspondence and other papers in addition to
                    photographs that include images of Kramrisch as a young woman in India and of
                    her cat. The album was compiled by Kramrisch's administrative assistant for a
                    biographical project that was never published. Two of the subjects documented in
                    the second subseries are posthumous matters, namely her estate and memorial.
                    Other subjects are honors and awards, insurance, and travel. The second series
                    pertains to Kramrisch's personal art collection, and includes documentation of
                    objects she gave to the Museum as gifts, loans and bequests. Objects include
                    Indian and Tibetan paintings, sculptures and books, as well as rugs, jewelry and
                    textiles and non-Indian objects, such as 19th century American metalwork and
                    hooked rugs. Documentation includes photographs, inventories and appraisal
                    lists. The material of Series 3, "Curatorial and teaching positions," pertains
                    to Kramrisch's appointments to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and to the
                    University of Pennsylvania, and to lectures she gave throughout the country from
                    the mid-1950s to mid-1980s. The museum files include the press release about her
                    death and some posthumous correspondence. Series 4, "Writings and research,"
                    pertains to books and articles Kramrisch wrote as well as a few items that
                    remained unpublished. The documentation of The Presence of Siva is extensive and
                    consists of manuscripts, proofs and reviews as well as some correspondence,
                    research and information regarding copyright registration and photographers. The
                    book was published by Oxford University Press in 1981 to coincide with the major
                    PMA exhibition curated by Kramrisch, "Manifestations of Shiva." There are also
                    several files to some of Kramrisch's earliest writings, such as a 1921 work
                    entitled, "The representation of nature in early Buddhist sculpture," and
                    dating from 1940-1941, "The hundred verses of Amaru illustrated," and "The
                    drawings of Rabindranath Tagore." Materials Kramrisch compiled apparently for
                    general reference comprise the final series and include index cards,
                    photographs, color transparencies, glass negatives, lantern slides, and
                    microfilm. Many of the images are of Indian temples. Other materials in the
                    Kramrisch papers include a processed collection of research notes, manuscripts,
                    photographs, color transparencies, glass and plastic slides, and some
                    correspondence. These materials are related to books, papers, and articles by
                    Kramrisch. A majority of the materials appear to be related to The Hindu Temple,
                    published in Calcutta in 1946. There are also materials related to Indian
                    Sculpture and the Presence of Siva and to articles, forwards, and reviews. There
                    are also research notes for an unfinished book on death that Kramrisch had
                    planned to co-author with Anindita Balsev and notes for what appears to be an
                    unfinished work on the numerology and cosmology of the ancient world. This
                    portion of the Kramrisch papers also includes clippings, articles and reviews by
                    others scholars, and translations of various Puranas and Vedic texts by S.K.
                    Pidara and other unidentified translators. Among the Kramrisch papers held by
                    the Museum, there are materials that have yet to be processed, including
                    research notes, manuscripts, reprints, correspondence, and photographs. The
                    research materials in this portion of the collection consist of notebooks
                    containing Kramrisch’s handwritten notes on readings and descriptions of sites
                    and objects. Manuscript material includes reviews and articles written by
                    Kramrisch, including drafts of her article for the Encyclopedia Americana on the
                    Architecture and Art of India. There are numerous reprints, articles, lecture
                    notes and reviews by other scholars, as well as some by Kramrisch. Many of the
                    reprints are inscribed by their authors. There is professional correspondence in
                    this portion of the collection relating to writings and scholarship by Kramrisch
                    and by others. There is also a series of postcards sent to Kramrisch from her
                    friend Helen Drutt. Photographic material in this portion of the collection
                    includes prints and negatives of Indian and Nepalese sculpture, architecture,
                    and painting. Other items in this portion of the collection include records of a
                    photography project in Bharhut, 1981-1985; an inventory of Kramrisch’s
                    collection of Eastern India metalwork, 1998; reel-to-reel audio recordings of
                    lectures given by Kramrisch, including a 1963 lecture on Indian sculpture;
                    certificates, diplomas, and plaques awarded to Kramrisch; newsletters from the
                    American Committee for South Asian Art, 1974-1990; and printouts from the PMA
                    project to catalog Kramrisch's library in 1995.</p>
