            <bioghist>
                <p>Langdon Warner, a scholar in Oriental Art and an Archeologist, was the Director
                    of the Museum from 1917 to 1923. He was often away from the Museum working in
                    China. In 1923 he left to accept a position at Harvard. In addition, he was the
                    Curator of the Wilstach Collection, a city-owned collection housed in Memorial
                    Hall.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>Warner's correspondence mainly concerns the collection, Memorial Hall,
                    exhibitions and purchases. There is some correspondence with corporate officers
                    including President, John D. McIlhenny. From December 1917 through January 1919
                    E. Hamilton Bell was Acting Director while Warner was away in China. Some of
                    Bell's correspondence is in this record group as a separate series. Bell also
                    was the Curator of the John G. Johnson Collection, another city-owned
                    collection, from 1917 until his death in 1929 (3/25/1929). Henri Marceau was his
                    Assistant Curator for the Johnson Collection. Bell was Co-Editor of a journal,
                    Eastern Art, along with Horace H. F. Jayne and Langdon Warner.</p>
