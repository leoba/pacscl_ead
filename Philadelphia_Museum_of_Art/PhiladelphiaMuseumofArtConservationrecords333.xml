            <bioghist>
                <p>The Conservation Department was established in 1966 under Theodor Siegl, who was
                    initially hired as a part-time conservator in 1955. Prior to Siegl's assuming
                    his position as full-time conservator, individual conservators were contracted
                    as needed. From 1955 to 1966, Siegl and his growing staff of assistants were
                    aligned with the Painting and Sculpture Department. In 1978 Marigene Butler
                    became Conservator and also in 1978 a new Conservation Laboratory was
                    opened.</p>
