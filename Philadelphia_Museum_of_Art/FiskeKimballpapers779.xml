            <bioghist>
                <p>Fiske Kimball (1888-1955) was a distinguished architectural historian and
                    director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. From his appointment in 1925 until
                    his retirement in 1955, he steered the institution, transforming it from what he
                    described as "a minor provincial position to become one of the leading museums
                    of America." Before coming to the Museum, Kimball was professor of architecture
                    and fine arts at the University of Michigan (1912-1919), professor of art and
                    architecture at the University of Virginia (1919-1923), and was in charge of the
                    fine arts department at New York University (1923-1925). He was the author of
                    Domestic Architecture of the American Colonies (1922), American Architecture
                    (1928), and The Creation of the Rococo (1943).</p>

                <p>This collection is an accrual to the Fiske Kimball papers. It consists of glass
                    negatives and lantern slides depicting American and European painting,
                    sculpture, architecture, and furniture from the Renaissance to the modern
                    period. The collection also includes film negatives. Kimball used these images
                    in lectures on architecture and fine arts.</p>
