            <bioghist>
                <p>Dr. Jean Sutherland Boggs (born 1922) has been an active and vital participant as
                    a scholar and administrator in the fine arts community in Canada and the United
                    States for more than half a century. Serving as the first woman director of the
                    National Gallery of Canada from 1966-1976, she taught art history as a professor
                    at Harvard University from 1976-1979. A distinguished art historian, Boggs has
                    published extensively on the life and work of Edgar Degas and organized several
                    exhibitions on the artistâ€™s work, receiving international recognition for her
                    scholarship. Following her precedent-making appointment in Canada, Boggs became
                    the first woman Director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. She served from
                    March 1979 to June 30, 1982, then left to become Chairman of the Canada Museums
                    Construction Corporation in Ottawa.</p>
