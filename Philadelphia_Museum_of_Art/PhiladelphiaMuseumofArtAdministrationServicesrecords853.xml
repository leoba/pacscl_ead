            <bioghist>
                <p>In 1973, plans to air-condition the Philadelphia Museum of Art's huge building
                    were approved. The ambitious program funded by the City of Philadelphia to
                    provide stable levels of temperature and humidity throughout the year was
                    completed by 1976. Concurrently, the first floor galleries in the south wing
                    were designed for the collections of American art and a new 13,500-square-foot
                    special exhibition gallery was constructed. Also during this time planning was
                    underway for the 1976 celebration of the Museum's centennial. [Need to describe
                    role of Assistant Director of Services to this activity...]</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>These are the records of Carl Colozzi, Assistant Director for Services,
                    1967-1979. Subjects include building services, building expansion and usage
                    during this time, as well as special construction for exhibitions and events.
                    Records of building the Student Center, installing the air-conditioning, and
                    rebuilding the American Wing are found here. The collection also includes
                    documentation of a legal action in connection with damage to the Museum's
                    Lansdowne Room that occurred during the installation of the air-conditioning.
                    Included are correspondence, reports, plans, minutes, and construction orders.
                    The materials are arranged into three chronological subgroups: 1965-1968; 1969;
                    and 1974-1980. </p>
