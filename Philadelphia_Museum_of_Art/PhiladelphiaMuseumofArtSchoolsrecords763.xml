            <bioghist>
                <p>Originally entitled the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, the
                    Museum was committed to maintaining schools for the training of young artists.
                    The School of Industrial Art was incorporated with the Museum in 1876 and
                    separated from the PMA in 1964. Currently its name is The Philadelphia College
                    of Art. The Textile School was created in 1884 and severed ties in 1948. It was
                    then called the Philadelphia Textile Institute, now the Philadelphia College of
                    Textiles and Science.</p>
