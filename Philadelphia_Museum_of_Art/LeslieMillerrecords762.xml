            <bioghist>
                <p>Leslie William Miller (1848-1931) was the first principal of the Pennsylvania
                    Museum and School of Industrial Art. Hired in 1880, he retired in 1920, and
                    remained as Principal Emeritus until 1930. The school opened in 1877, and under
                    Miller's leadership it grew from just a few drawing classes to an extensive arts
                    curriculum that would come to include art education, illustration, architectural
                    drafting, interior design, sculpture, painting, pottery, stage and costume
                    design, metal and iron work, furniture, stained glass, bookbinding, and museum
                    curatorship. Miller studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,
                    and graduated from the Massachusetts Normal Art School (now Massachusetts
                    College of Art) in 1880. Miller was thoroughly involved in the art world in
                    Philadelphia: he was a founder and officer of the Art Club of Philadelphia, an
                    honorary member of the T-Square Club (which was housed in the PMSIA school
                    building for a time) and of the American Institute of Architects' Philadelphia
                    chapter, secretary of the Fairmount Park Art Association from 1900-1920, a
                    member of the American Philosophical Society, the Historical Society of
                    Pennsylvania, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the
                    Pennsylvania Association of Master Painters and Decorators, and the Boston Art
                    Club.</p>
