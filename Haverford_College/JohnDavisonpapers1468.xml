            <bioghist>
                <p>John Davison (1930-1999) was a composer-pianist who studied at Juilliard,
                    Haverford College, Harvard, and Eastman. Among his teachers were Alfred Swan,
                    Randall Thompson, Walter Piston, Bernard Rogers, Howard Hanson, Alan Hovhaness,
                    and Robert Palmer. Davison taught at Haverford College from 1959 until his
                    death. His music was published and recorded and has been played widely in the
                    United States, as well as in Europe and Asia. He wrote for most of the standard
                    media, as well as for unusual instruments such as koto, cimbalom, and bagpipe.
                    Davison's idiom was rooted in the great Western classic-romantic tradition with
                    Baroque, Renaissance, jazz, modernist, and folk elements mixing in at times.</p>
