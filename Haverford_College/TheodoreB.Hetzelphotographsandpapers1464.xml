            <bioghist>
                <p>Theodore Brinton Hetzel was born in 1906 in Germantown, Pennsylvania, and
                    attended Westtown School and Haverford College, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in
                    1928. He completed graduate studies in mechanical engineering at the University
                    of Pennsylvania, the Technical University of Munich (Germany), and Penn State
                    University. He returned to Haverford College in 1936 as a member of the faculty
                    and later chair of the Department of Engineering. Hetzel served on the Indian
                    committees of the American Friends Service Committee and the Philadelphia Yearly
                    Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. In 1955, the Indian Rights
                    Association asked him to join its board of directors. In 1969 the Association
                    appointed him as its executive director and editor of its publication, Indian
                    Truth. In 1971 he was named general secretary. He retired from Haverford College
                    in 1972. An avid photographer, Hetzel was a contract photographer for Haverford
                    College.</p>
