            <bioghist>
                <p>Gene Knudsen-Hoffman is a Quaker peace activist and a pioneer in the
                    Compassionate Listening movement. As a member of the Fellowship of
                    Reconciliation (FOR), she traveled dozens of times to the Middle East and the
                    former Soviet Union during the 1980s and 1990s to do reconciliation work. She
                    has met with and listened to Palestinians and Israelis, and published articles,
                    books, and pamphlets about her experiences, including Pieces of the Mideast
                    Puzzle (1991) and No Royal Road to Reconciliation (1995). She has published over
                    a hundred articles as well as books, poems and pamphlets and given many
                    workshops and talks about peacemaking. </p>
