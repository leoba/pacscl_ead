            <bioghist>
                <p>Sasan S. Mehrara graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1994. He
                    received his law degree from George Washington University in 1997 and is
                    currently a partner in the real estate department of Simpson Thatcher &amp;
                    Bartlett, LLP. Russell Stetler was a Haverford student who participated in
                    campus anti-war activities. In 1963-1964 he circulated an anti-war petition,
                    which resulted in complaints from a veteran's group and investigation by the
                    college and the Philadelphia Board of Education.</p>
