            <bioghist>
                <p>Paul Weiss (1901-2002) was a philosopher known particularly for his work in
                    metaphysics. He graduated from City College with a degree in philosophy and then
                    studied with noted philosopher Alfred North Whitehead at Harvard University,
                    where he earned his Ph.D. in 1929. He lectured for a year at Harvard and
                    Radcliffe and then taught at Bryn Mawr before moving to Yale. Professor Weiss
                    taught at Yale from 1946 until his retirement in 1969 as Sterling Professor of
                    Philosophy. Weiss was the founder of the Metaphysical Society of America in 1947
                    and of its academic journal, Review of Metaphysics. He served as the journal's
                    editor until 1964. He was the author of more than 30 books on topics such as
                    cosmology, theology, and aesthetics.</p>
