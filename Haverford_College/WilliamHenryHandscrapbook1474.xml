            <bioghist>
                <p>William Henry Hand (1900-1978) served as Thomas Edison's laboratory assistant for
                    six years on various experiments and inventions until 1930. He also had a number
                    of inventions of his own, including the Hand storage battery, none of which were
                    patented. He graduated from Haverford College in 1934.</p>
