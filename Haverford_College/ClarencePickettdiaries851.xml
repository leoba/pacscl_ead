            <bioghist>
                <p>Clarence E. Pickett (1884-1965) served as executive secretary of the American
                    Friends Service Committee from 1929 to 1950. Educated at Penn College, Iowa,
                    Hartford Theological Seminary, and Harvard, he served as a Quaker minister in
                    Toronto and Oskaloosa, as national secretary of Young Friends' activities, and
                    as professor of biblical literature at Earlham College. Deeply committed to
                    social justice and pacifism, he provided advice and service to four U.S.
                    presidents (Herbert Hoover, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and John F.
                    Kennedy) on a range of matters including the plight of coal-mining communities,
                    humane immigration policies, relief for war-torn Europe and Asia, and the
                    progress of the Peace Corps.</p>
