            <bioghist>
                <p>Morris E. Leeds (1869-1952) was the son of Barclay R. Leeds (1834-1918) and Mary
                    Maule Leeds. He graduated from Haverford College in 1888. His brother Arthur
                    Newlin Leeds (1870-1939) also attended Haverford and was a noted naturalist.
                    Their uncle, Lewis W. Leeds (ca. 1827-1896), was a Quaker businessman who
                    promoted the use of a patent envelope in the years prior to the Civil War.</p>
