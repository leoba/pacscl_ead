                <p>The Cadburys are a prominent Quaker family in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Sarah
                    Cadbury (1840-1918) was the daughter of Joel Cadbury (1799-1870) and Caroline
                    Warder Cadbury (1801-1868). She was a member of the House of Industry of the
                    Female Society of Philadelphia for the Relief and Employment of the Poor. John
                    (Jack) Cadbury (b.1912) was the son of John Warder Cadbury (1880-1948) and

                    War Victims Relief Committee assisting with Friends work in England.</p>
