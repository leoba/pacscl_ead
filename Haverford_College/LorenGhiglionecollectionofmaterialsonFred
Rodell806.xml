            <bioghist>
                <p>Fred Rodell was a 1926 graduate of Haverford College. Rodell studied under
                    Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas at Yale Law School. He was a professor
                    of law at Yale for 41 years and was one of the leading proponents of the "legal
                    realism" approach, railing against overly abstract and theoretical legal
                    arguments. He was a harsh critic of the legal profession; his articles include
                    "Goodbye to Law Reviews," published in the 1936 Virginia Law Review, and the
                    1939 tract "Woe Unto You, Lawyers." Loren Ghiglione serves on the faculty of
                    Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism and was formerly its dean.
                    He was founding director of Emory University's journalism program where he was
                    the James M. Cox Professor of Journalism. Later, he served as director of the
                    Annenberg School of Journalism at the University of Southern California.
                    Ghiglione graduated from Haverford College in 1963 and holds a law degree and
                    master of urban studies from Yale and a doctorate from George Washington
                    University.</p>
