            <bioghist>
                <p>The Waring, Whitall, Carter, and Evans families were prominent Quakers from
                    Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. The Waring family arrived in the United
                    States in 1775. The first generation of Warings to settle in Cecil County,
                    Maryland, included Thomas (1755-1842) and William (d. 1793). Thomas Waring's
                    children included William Waring (1808-1884). William Waring had four sons:
                    Thomas, Wilson (d. 1917), David, and William (1849-1934). Bernard Gilpin Waring
                    (b. 1876) was one of Thomas' children. John Mickle Whitall (1800-1877) of
                    Woodbury, New Jersey and his wife Mary Tatum (1803-1880) were the parents of
                    James Whitall (1834-1896), who married Mary Wistar Cope (ca. 1836-1897), and
                    Hannah Whitall (1832-1911), who married Robert Pearsall Smith. Charles Evans was
                    a 1902 graduate of Haverford and professor of German at Bucknell and Temple
                    University.</p>
