            <bioghist>
                <p>John S. Hilles was the son of Samuel Hilles (1788-1873) and Margaret Hill Smith
                    (1786-1881). He attended Haverford in 1844, leaving in 1845 because of the
                    temporary closing of the school. He was in the shipping business in
                    Philadelphia. In 1862 he married Sarah Cooper Tatum (1832-1914). His brother,
                    William Smith Hilles (1825-1876), attended Haverford in the first class of
                    students in 1833. He left the college and returned as a member of the class of
                    1840. He worked in manufacturing and banking. Sarah's brother was John Cooper
                    Tatum. He attended Haverford from 1850 to 1852. He was a farmer and the Director
                    of the First National Bank in Woodbury, New Jersey. Their parents were Joseph
                    Tatum and Anne Cooper Tatum.</p>
