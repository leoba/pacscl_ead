                <p>The Friends Council on Education, founded by a group of volunteer Quaker
                    educators in 1931, promotes the theory and practice of Quaker education,
                    supports Friends schools (pre-kindergarten through 12th grade) in maintaining
                    their values-based learning environments, and provides a professional
                    development network for educational issues, philosophy and practice in Friends
                    schools.</p>
