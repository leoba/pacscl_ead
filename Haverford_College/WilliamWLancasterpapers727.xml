            <bioghist>
                <p>William Woart Lancaster (b. 1874) was a partner in the law firm Shearman,
                    Sterling &amp; Wright. He was Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Foreign
                    Policy Association. He also served as Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of
                    the American-Russian Institute and the Secretary of the American Society for
                    Russian Relief, Inc.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of correspondence, memos, and "day notes" of William
                    Lancaster. "Day notes" include Lancaster's daily schedules and typed summaries
                    of selected activities. Correspondence relates to Lancaster's business
                    activities in international trade, as well as his interest in the political
                    relations between the U.S.S.R. and the United States, and, more broadly, between
                    the U.S.S.R. and the West. The collection includes reports on the efforts of the
                    American Friends Service Committee to improve relations between the U.S. and the
                    U.S.S.R. Many of the letters in the collection reveal Lancaster's role as a
                    liaison between American Friends Service Committee members and various political
                    figures. </p>
