            <bioghist>
                <p>Jacob R. Elfreth (1789-1870) was a Philadelphia Quaker who compiled the Elfreth
                    Book of Letters, a series of writings by his children. He was one of the
                    earliest students at Westtown School. Joseph Elfreth (b. 1824), the oldest of
                    Jacob's children, was apprenticed to a linen merchant in 1840, but did not
                    remain in that line of work long. He moved to Haddonfield, New Jersey, in 1852,
                    where he married Hannah Hill and worked as a salesman. Another member of the
                    family, Florence H. Elfreth, married Samuel Bispham Redman in 1875.</p>
