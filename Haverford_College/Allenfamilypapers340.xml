            <bioghist>
                <p>Samuel Leeds Allen (1841-1918) was an inventor and industrialist, whose most
                    famous invention was the Flexible Flyer, the world's first steerable runner
                    sled. He was awarded almost 300 patents for a wide range of farming machinery,
                    including the fertilizer drill, seed drill, potato digger, cultivator, furrower,
                    pulverizer, grass edger and numerous other farm implements. He married Sallie H.
                    Roberts. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection consists of family correspondence of the Allens from 1846 to 1931.
                    The letters are primarily written by the women of the family, originally the
                    Roberts of Chester County, Pennsylvania, and the Allen family of Cinnaminson,
                    New York. Samuel and Sallie Allen's daughter, Susan J. Allen, dominates the
                    later correspondence. In her letters, she describes her travels in the United
                    States and abroad. The Samuel Leeds Allen correspondence is written primarily to
                    Elisha Roberts, Sarah Allen, and Susan Allen. It concerns family and personal
                    subjects, for the most part, but includes a small amount of correspondence on
                    business matters.</p>
