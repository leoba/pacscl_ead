            <bioghist>
                <p>Joseph Scotton Elkinton (1830-1905) was the son of Joseph and Mary (Nutt)
                    Elkinton and was born at Tunesassa, N.Y. where his father taught school. In 1831
                    the family moved to Philadelphia. Joseph S. and his brother Thomas continued the
                    soap business begun by their father. He married Malinda Patterson (1836-1920) in
                    1856 and they had four children: Mary Patterson, Joseph, Alfred Cope and William
                    Tillman. Joseph S. Elkinton was a minister and very active member of the
                    Philadelphia Meeting. He was especially interested in Native Americans and made
                    religious journeys to the Senecas, Mennonites and Doukhobors. Nathaniel Peabody
                    Rogers (1794-1846) graduated from Dartmouth in 1816, and practised law until
                    1838, when he established in Concord, New Hampshire, the "Herald of Freedom,"
                    a pioneer anti-slavery newspaper. He also wrote for the New York "Tribune"
                    under the signature of "The Old Man of the Mountain." His fugitive writings
                    were published, with a memoir, by the Reverend John Pierpont (Concord,
                    1847).</p>
