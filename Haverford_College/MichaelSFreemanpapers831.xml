            <bioghist>
                <p>Michael Stuart Freeman (1946-1999) received his undergraduate degree from
                    Brooklyn College and Master's degrees in library science and history from the
                    University of Wisconsin-Madison. He served as Librarian of the College at
                    Haverford College from 1986 until his death. He had previously worked in library
                    and archives positions at Illinois Wesleyan University, Dartmouth College, and
                    the College of Wooster. Between 1994 and 1997, he published three articles on
                    issues related to Tri-College library policies, and, at the time of his death,
                    was working on an analysis of an early twentieth-century Haverford alumnus's
                    college diary.</p>
