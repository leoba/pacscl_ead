            <bioghist>
                <p>Harry B. Goldstein (1908-1991) was an avid birder and a member of the Delaware
                    Valley Ornithological Club and the Cooper Ornithological Club.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection consists of notebooks, journals, checklists, and other
                    documentation related to Goldstein's birding activities. There are 23 notebooks
                    containing lists of birds sited, and narrative descriptions of birding trips in
                    Pennsylvania and New Jersey, as well as many other parts of the world, including
                    India, Israel, Central America, and Jamaica, dating from 1936 to 1986. One
                    journal includes Goldstein's reflections on his "hoboing" adventures from the
                    1920s to 1950s. There are also 45 notebooks listing plants, animals, and birds
                    seen from the 1930s to 1983. Some volumes include location and weather
                    information. The collection also includes several printed daily checklists for
                    birds seen; a scrapbook entitled "Little Nature Studies" with photographs,
                    drawings, charts, and newspaper clippings; manuscripts for "Birds of Israel,"
                    "Random Thoughts of a Naturalist" and "Our Allies-the Snakes"; and
                    additional birding notes.</p>
