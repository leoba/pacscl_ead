                <p>Charles C.G. Chaplin (d. 1991) was a research associate in the Department of

                    Louise endowed the Chaplin Chair of Ichthology in 1959. He participated in
                    several of the Academy's collecting expeditions to Florida, the Caribbean, and
                    South America. With James E. Bohlke, he coauthored Fishes of the Bahamas and
                    Adjacent Tropical Waters, 1968. </p>

                <p>This is a collection of nine volumes of stamps (1959-1981), arranged by subject,

                    a series of stamps issued by Australia featuring fish collected by an Academy
                    expedition to the Indian Ocean in 1979 and photographs and negatives of fish
                    from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</p>
