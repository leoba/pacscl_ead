            <bioghist>
                <p>Morgan Hebard (1887-1946) was an entomologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences.
                    Hebard began studying and collecting Orthoptera as a young man; at the age of
                    sixteen his association with the Academy began when he consulted the staff to
                    determine some of his Lepidoptera specimens. After his graduation in 1910, he
                    worked for a year in banking, before resigning to spend his time on research. He
                    continued to collect and study Orthoptera until his death, shortly before which
                    he presented his collection of approximately 250,000 specimens to the
                    Academy.</p>
