            <bioghist>
                <p>Harrison Allen (1841-1897) was an American physician and anatomist, born in
                    Philadelphia. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1861, and in
                    1862 became a surgeon in the United States army and served until the conclusion
                    of the Civil War in 1865. In 1865 he was made professor of comparative anatomy
                    and medical zo√∂logy at the University of Pennsylvania. He was transferred in
                    1878 to the chair of physiology, which he occupied until 1895. George H. Horn
                    (1840-1897) was a physician and entomologist. He received his Doctor of Medicine
                    degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1861, and was commissioned as a
                    surgeon in a cavalry unit of the U.S. Army in 1863. He served in the Army in
                    California until 1866. In that year, he returned to Philadelphia, and was
                    elected President of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia. Over the next 30
                    years, he published 265 scientific papers, establishing 154 new genera and 1582
                    new species, all while continuing his medical practice as an obstetrician.
                    Edward James Nolan was secretary, librarian, and editor for the Academy of
                    Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and was a very active participant in every
                    branch and aspect of the Academy.</p>
