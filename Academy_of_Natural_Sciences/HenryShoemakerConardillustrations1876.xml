            <bioghist>
                <p>Henry Shoemaker Conard (1874-1971) was a native of Pennsylvania who earned his
                    bachelor's and master's degrees at Haverford College and a Ph.D. at the
                    University of Pennsylvania. As a Senior Harrison Fellow in Botany at the
                    University of Pennsylvania, four years of study led to the publication of his
                    landmark monograph on the genus Nymphaea, The Waterlilies, by The Carnegie
                    Institution of Washington in 1905. In 1906 Conard joined the faculty of Grinnell
                    College in Iowa as professor of botany. There he gained international
                    recognition as an authority on mosses and waterlilies. He was honored by the
                    Botanical Society of America on its 50th anniversary as a "taxonomist,
                    morphologist, mycologist, ecologist, bryologist...and above all a beloved
                    teacher." He retired to Florida in 1944, where he continued his research and
                    publishing until his death in 1971 at 97.</p>

                <p>The collection consists of drawings, watercolors, and printed plates of Nymphaea
                    (water lilies). One watercolor is signed by Percy Highley and dated 1903. The
                    plates were printed by A. Horn &amp; Co., Baltimore. There are a number of
                    Conard's sketches, tracings, and notes, taken from specimens at herbaria in
                    England and Germany. The collection also includes four black and white
                    photographs of water lilies.</p>
