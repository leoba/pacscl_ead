            <bioghist>
                <p>Ezra Townsend Cresson (1838-1926) was an entomologist, specializing in
                    Hymenoptera. After becoming a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Cresson
                    joined with James Ridings and George Newman to found the Entomological Society
                    of Philadelphia, in which he held office through 1924. He was one of the first
                    editors of the "Practical Entomologist" and established the "Entomological
                    News." His memoir of Thomas B. Wilson and his history of the American
                    Entomological Society are considered outstanding historical treatises. Cresson's
                    many years of scientific study culminated in his Synopsis of the Hymenoptera of
                    North America.</p>

                    and some handwritten) on Ephydridae, or shore flies. There are also pencil and
                    ink anatomical illustrations for articles. The collection also includes four
                    card file boxes that contain bibliographic information on entomological
                    resources (by year, by geography, by species), and membership cards for the
                    American Entomological Society.</p>
