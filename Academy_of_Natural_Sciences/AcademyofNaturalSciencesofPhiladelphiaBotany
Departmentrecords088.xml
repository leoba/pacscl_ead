                <p>The Botany Department of the Academy of Natural Sciences conducts research on
                    plant biodiversity and evolution, and maintains the Academy's herbarium. Because
                    the Academy was one of the first scientific institutions in the New World, the
                    herbarium holds some of the oldest and most important plant collections in the
                    Americas. The herbarium contains about 1.5 million dried, pressed specimens and
                    plays a vital role as a resource for research on plants and on the history of
                    American botany.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of records related to the Academy's Botany department.

                    related to the acquisition and identification of specimens (1877-1920).
                    Notebooks and catalogs of the Botany Department include: a paleobotany catalog,
                    1971-1975; an index to ferns at the Academy, 1880; a catalog of lichens;
                    catalogs of the Arthur Leeds, S.S. Van Pelt, and William M. Thompson
                    collections; exchange books; a telephone and address book; herbarium notebooks

                    the specimen catalogues for the Wagner Free Institute of Science Herbarium,
                    which is held at the Academy (the original catalogs are at the Wagner). Other
                    records in the collection are the notebooks and collection lists of Ida. K.
                    Langman, from Monroe County, Pennsylvania, and Mexico; photographs of fungi by
                    E. Sterling, circa 1920; manuscripts and other documents related to
                    nomenclature; notes and publications by Joan Apfelbaum, 1970s; a photocopy of a
                    handwritten bibliography, "Historical Bibliography of Botanists represented in
                    ANSP Botany Collections," by A. E. Schuyler; and Schuyler's files on small
                    projects and small contracts from 1974 to 1997. Most of these projects were
                    conducted at local sites; the records include ecological studies and lists of
                    plants observed or collected.</p>
