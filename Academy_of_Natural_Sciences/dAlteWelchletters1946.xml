            <bioghist>
                <p>d’Alté Aldridge Welch was born in 1907 and attended Johns Hopkins where he
                    received his Masters in 1931 and his Ph.D. in 1937. He was a research fellow in
                    the Department of Mollusks at the Academy of Natural Sciences and was elected a
                    life member in 1928.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of correspondence to Welch (1924-1952), almost all from
                    Henry A. Pilsbry. Correspondence is relatively social in nature, arranging
                    dinner plans, for example, with a small amount of discussion of Welch's career,
                    and the work being done at the Academy. </p>
            </scopecontent>


            <accessrestrict>
                <p>The collection is open for research.</p>
