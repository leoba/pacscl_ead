            <bioghist>
                <p>Amateur botanist and student of sponges, Edward Potts was best known for his
                    publications about fresh-water sponges. He was a member of the Academy of
                    Natural Sciences.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is Edward Potts' collection of reprints and monographs from the late 19th
                    century and early 20th century. Many of the reprints focus on sponges and marine
                    biology, though there are other topics included, such as evolution, fisheries,
                    Philadelphia's water supply, astronomy, and memorials to noted scientists. The
                    collection also includes a series of letters and postcards sent from Henry Mills
                    (a fellow collector of sponges) to Edward Potts between 1880 and 1889,
                    concerning their discoveries, descriptions, and naming of fresh water sponges.
