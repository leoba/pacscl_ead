            <bioghist>
                <p>Annette Braun (1884-1978) was a botanist, artist, photographer, writer,
                    homemaker, and noted microlepidopterist. She received her bachelor's, master's,
                    and Ph.D. degrees in zoology from the University of Cincinnati. She was the
                    first woman to receive a Ph.D. from the University. Her 1911 doctoral thesis was
                    "Observations in the Development of Color in the Pupal Wings of Several Species
                    of Lithocolletis." She taught briefly at the University, the only paid job she
                    ever held. She lived with and assisted her sister Lucy (a botanist and professor
                    at the University of Cincinnati) in writing scientific papers and books. She
                    collected and studied Microlepidoptera, and published four monographs and 63
                    articles. She was elected a Correspondent to the Academy of Natural Sciences in
                    1949, where she had been an Honorary Life Member since 1930.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of a typed manuscript of Braun's paper, "Origin of the
                    Heteroneurous Type of Lepidopterous Venation," and two charts displaying wings
                    with species name, degree of enlargement, and code numbers. The charts were
                    probably drawn by Braun.</p>
