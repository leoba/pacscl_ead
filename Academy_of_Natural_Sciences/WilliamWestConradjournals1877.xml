            <bioghist>
                <p>William West Conrad (1904-1981) of Devon, Pennsylvania, was a big game hunter who
                    assembled one of the world's largest taxidermic collections of animals. Early in
                    his career, Conrad worked in the tax department of the Girard Trust Co. He
                    served in World War II as a sergeant in the Army. After the war he worked with
                    the Veterans Administration in Philadelphia. His animal collection was donated
                    to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.</p>
