                <p>James Bohkle (1930-1982) was an ichthyologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences
                    of Philadelphia. He received his Ph.D. in biological sciences from Stanford
                    University in 1954, and then joined the Academy the same year as an assistant
                    curator to work with Charles Chaplin on a book of Bahaman fishes. He was named
                    chair of the department in 1960, a position he held until his death in 1982. He
                    was also curator of the ichthyology collection (1963-1982). His research
                    interests were the systematics and life histories of neotropical fishes and eels
                    of the world.</p>
