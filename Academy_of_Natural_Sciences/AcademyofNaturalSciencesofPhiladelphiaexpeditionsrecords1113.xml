            <bioghist>
                <p>The first Academy of Natural Sciences trip took most of the members to Perkiomen
                    Copper Mines by horse and buggy, April 18, 1812. During the ensuing years
                    Academy personnel has been part of thousands of treks into new collecting areas.
                    Often the expeditions were privately financed or sent out by the Academy under
                    grants from research foundations. Sometimes Academy scientists accompanied U.S.
                    government expeditions. During recent years a committee of the council has acted
                    to choose official names for special expeditions.</p>
