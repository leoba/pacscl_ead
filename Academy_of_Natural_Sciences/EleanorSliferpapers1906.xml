                    Sciences of Philadelphia. Slifer received her Masters and Ph.D. degrees from the
                    University of Pennsylvania (in 1926 and 1930, respectively). She taught for a

                    until 1963, when she returned to Philadelphia to join the Academy as a as a
                    research fellow in the Department of Entomology. Her research interests were
                    insect anatomy, physiology, development, genetics, behavior, and especially
                    sense organs (chemoreceptors).</p>
