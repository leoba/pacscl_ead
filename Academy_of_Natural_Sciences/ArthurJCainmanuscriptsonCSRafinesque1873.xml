            <bioghist>
                <p>Arthur J. Cain (1921-1999) was an evolutionary biologist whose research interests
                    include genetics, natural selection, biogeography, and systematics. A professor
                    at Oxford University and, later, the University of Liverpool, much of Cain's
                    research was been field-based, focusing on terrestrial gatsropods. Constantine
                    Samuel Rafinesque (1783-1840) was a professor of botany, natural history and
                    modern languages at Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky from 1818 to
                    1826. He published on a wide variety of topics, including botany, ichthyology,
                    economics, and the Bible.</p>
