            <bioghist>
                <p>Alexander Agassiz (1835–1910) was an American naturalist and industrialist. He
                    was the son of of Louis Agassiz and stepson of Elizabeth Cary Agassiz. He came
                    to the United States in 1849 and studied at Harvard, receiving degrees in
                    engineering (1857) and natural history (1862). Throughout his life he was
                    connected in various capacities with Harvard. In 1871 he consolidated the
                    Calumet and Hecla copper mines on Lake Superior and, as president, successfully
                    developed the combined interests. He adopted safety and welfare measures
                    relating to the mines. Agassiz contributed much of his fortune to
                    science—chiefly in endowments to Harvard and to the Museum of Comparative
                    Zoology which his father helped to found. In 1877 he began oceanographic
                    explorations, including detailed observations of the Pacific and the Caribbean.
                    Noting that the deep-sea animals of the two are similar, he suggested that the
                    Caribbean was a bay of the Pacific that had been cut off in the Cretaceous
                    period by the rise of the Panama isthmus. His chief work is Revision of the
                    Echini (in two volumes, 1872–1874).</p>
