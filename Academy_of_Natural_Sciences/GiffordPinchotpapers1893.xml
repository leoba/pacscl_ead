            <bioghist>
                <p>Gifford Pinchot (1865-1946) was the first Chief of the United States Forest
                    Service (1905-1910) and twice the Governor of Pennsylvania (1923-1927,
                    1931-1935). He is famous for reforming the management and development of forests
                    in the United States and for advocating conservation of the nation's forest
                    reserves by planned use and renewal. He coined the term conservation as applied
                    to natural resources.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of glass and film negatives documenting Pinchot's
                    expeditions to the Galapagos and the Caribbean. Photos show Pinchot, Cornelia
                    Bryce Pinchot, Dr. Henry A. Pilsbry, and other expedition members. Photo sleeves
                    are labeled, and there is also a typed description of some of the images. The
                    collection also includes letters (typescript) written by his wife, Cornelia
                    Bryce Pinchot, describing a trip to Iran in 1949, including interactions with
                    other Western visitors, and an audience with the Shah. </p>
