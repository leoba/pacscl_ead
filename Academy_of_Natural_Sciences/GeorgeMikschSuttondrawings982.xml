            <bioghist>
                <p>George Miksch Sutton (1898 - 1982) was an American ornithologist and bird artist.
                    He published numerous technical papers in ornithology as well as more popular
                    works illustrated with his own art. His early artistic work was inspired and
                    tutored by Louis Agassiz Fuertes. In 1931, he was the first ornithologist to
                    find the eggs of the Harris's Sparrow, one of the last North American birds to
                    have its nest and eggs described. He did extensive field work in the Arctic
                    (including Iceland), Oklahoma, Labrador, and Mexico. He received his doctorate
                    from Cornell University and held academic posts at the University of Michigan
                    and the University of Oklahoma, Norman.</p>
