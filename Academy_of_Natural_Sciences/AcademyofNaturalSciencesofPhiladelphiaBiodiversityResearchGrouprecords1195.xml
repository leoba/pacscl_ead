                <p>The Biodiversity Research Group of the Academy of Natural Sciences, now known as
                    the Center for Systematic Biology and Evolution, cares for and expands the
                    Academy of Natural Sciences' natural history collections. The scientists at the
                    Center conduct significant research into biodiversity, ecology, evolution,
                    molecular systematics and paleontology.</p>

                    projects. The collection also includes a bound volume: "Long Range Planning for
                    Systematics and Evolutionary Biology," prepared by George M. Davis and staff in
