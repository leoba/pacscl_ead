                    Province of Friesland, the Netherlands. He studied medicine and became a
                    physician in 1858, and worked as a physician in the town of Jisp and thereafter
                    on the island of Marken. Van Rijgersma served as the government physician on the
                    island St. Martin in Netherlands Antilles from 1863 until his death in 1877.</p>
