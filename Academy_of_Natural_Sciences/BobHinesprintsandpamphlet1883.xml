            <bioghist>
                <p>Robert W. (Bob) Hines (1912-1994), was an American wildlife artist who had a long
                    career with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Born in Columbus, Ohio,
                    Hines had virtually no formal training in art or in wildlife science, yet by the
                    age of twenty-seven he was working as staff artist with the Ohio Division of
                    Wildlife, and in 1947 (or 1948) he accepted a similar position with the United
                    States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). He illustrated many works for the
                    USFWS, including Ducks at a Distance, Migration of Birds, Fifty Birds of Town
                    and City, and entries in the Wildlife Portrait Series (including Song Birds and
                    Alaska). His illustrations were also used in such works as Wildlife in America
                    by Peter Matthiessen.</p>
