            <bioghist>
                <p>Sherwood Raymond Roberts (1845-1928) was a conchologist and a member of the
                    Academy of Natural Sciences. He was elected to the Academy in 1866, and was one
                    of the first members of the Academy's Conchological Section. His main interest
                    was in Cypraeidae, and he published a monograph on this family in 1885. His
                    collection of Cypraeidae specimens is now among the holdings of the Academy.</p>
