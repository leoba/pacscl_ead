            <bioghist>
                <p>The Wilderness Club was founded in 1912. The original aim of the club was to
                    bring together hunters, nature photographers, natural scientists, and travelers
                    for the purposes of protecting, preserving, and restoring wildlife. The club's
                    mission, as stated in 1998, is "to promote the safeguarding of habitat and
                    wilderness areas where rare and endangered species are at risk of becoming
                    extinct and to support programs for conservation of these species."</p>
