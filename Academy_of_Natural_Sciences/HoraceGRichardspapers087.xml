            <bioghist>
                <p>Horace G. Richards (1906-1984) was a geologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences
                    of Philadelphia. He received his Ph.D. in zoology and paleontology from the
                    University of Pennsylvania in 1932. He worked at the Smithsonian Institution and
                    at the New Jersey State Museum before joining the Academy in 1937 as a research
                    fellow. He became Chairman of the Department of Geology and Paleontology in 1960
                    and served in that capacity until his retirement in 1974. He published more than
                    260 scientific papers and was the author of six books on earth science and
                    marine fossils. He was an authority on the geologic formations of the Atlantic
                    coastal plain, and spearheaded the Academy's Atlantic Coastal Plain Project in
                    1947 to collect and study fossils and well samples from the Coastal Plain.
                    Richards was also president of the Shorelines Commission of INQUA (the
                    International Union for Quaternary Research). </p>
