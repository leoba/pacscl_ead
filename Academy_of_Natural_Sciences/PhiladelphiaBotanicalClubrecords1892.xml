            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Botanical Society was founded in 1891. The membership consists
                    of professional botanists, interested amateurs, and collectors. In 1908 the
                    publication of the serial Bartonia was initiated, which has continued to the
                    present time, although appearing somewhat irregularly.</p>

                <p>Manuscript and typed minutes of monthly meetings of the Philadelphia Botanical
                    Club between January 1959 and December 1961. Minutes were kept primarily by
                    Walter M. Benner, recording secretary. Minutes document the club's business,
                    such as nominations for membership, and provide brief descriptions of programs
                    held at the monthly meetings. Presenters included Ida K. Langman, speaking on
                    the topic of botanical studies in Mexico. The collection also includes a list of
                    contributions for an anniversary gift in honor of Bayard Long in 1944 and an
                    excerpt from Bartonia about funds given by members of the club to the Academy of
                    Natural Sciences Botany Department.</p>
