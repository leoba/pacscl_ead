            <bioghist>
                <p>Elisha Kent Kane (1820-1857) was a naval officer, physician, and explorer. He
                    served as senior medical officer on the First Grinnell expedition to the Arctic
                    and organized and commanded the Second Grinnell expedition. He was elected to
                    the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1843, before his arctic explorations. Kane
                    gave the specimens of birds, mammals, and plants that he collected on these
                    voyages to the Academy.</p>
