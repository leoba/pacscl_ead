                <p>Since its founding in 1812, researchers from the Academy have collected specimens
                    from all points on the globe. These collections have grown over the last two
                    centuries. Today, the Center for Systematic Biology and Evolution at the Academy
                    cares for and studies over 17 million specimens of plants and animals, both
                    extant and fossil. The collections are of national and international
                    significance. Among these are the world's largest collection of Orthoptera
                    (crickets &amp; grasshoppers), the world's largest collection of diatoms
                    (microscopic aquatic plants), the world's second largest collection of mollusks,
                    and the worlds most comprehensive collection of Rotifera on microscope
                    slides.</p>
