            <bioghist>
                <p>Philip Pearsall Carpenter (1819-1877) in early life was an English minister,
                    educator, philanthropist and reformer with a special interest in natural history
                    as a hobby. Later he became a specialist in the study of mollusks and wrote two
                    monographic works which were published, shorter papers, and an unpublished
                    monumental work on Chitons. He visited the United States, where he became
                    associated with the California Academy of Sciences in 1857 and studied West
                    Coast shells. He returned to England for a short time and in 1865 moved to
                    Montreal. His collections that were not included in the British Museum, the
                    Smithsonian or the California Academy of Sciences were given to Magill
                    University in Montreal.</p>
