            <bioghist>
                <p>The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia was founded in 1812 "for the
                    encouragement and cultivation of the sciences, and the advancement of useful
                    learning." Its collections, acquired through expeditions, gifts, purchases, and
                    exchanges, contain over 17,000,000 specimens. The Academy opened its doors to
                    the public in 1828, growing so rapidly that it outgrew its building three times
                    in sixty years. In 1876, its present home was built at 19th and Benjamin
                    Franklin Parkway. In 1948, with the establishment of the Environmental Research
                    Division, the Academy broadened its research orientation to include applied
                    research in aquatic ecosystems as well as the traditional systematics
                    research--discovering and cataloguing organisms. </p>
