            <bioghist>
                <p>The Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia was founded in 1812 "for the
                    encouragement and cultivation of the sciences, and the advancement of useful
                    learning." The Communications Department is responsible for external affairs of
                    the Academy, including public and media relations.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of records of the Communications Department of the Academy
                    of Natural Sciences. The collection includes correspondence, marketing and event
                    planning documents; minutes; press releases (1967-1997); press kits; brochures,
                    programs, schedules, and advertisements; financial documents; educational and
                    promotional videos; teacher guides; photos and slides of events and programs;
                    and subject files related to Academy exhibits, publications, and projects. There
                    is a set of 16 scrapbooks, kept between 1967 and 1987, that contain newspaper
                    and magazine clippings about Academy events and staff, plus one earlier
                    scrapbook covering the years 1928 to 1955. In addition, there are loose press
                    clippings dating from 1966 to 1999. There are a number of photographs of staff
                    and exhibits, as well as "stock" photos of animals, plants, and geological
                    features. Notable programs and events covered by the collection include
                    Dinofest, the Schuykill River Symposium (1980), the Schuykill River Watershed
                    Initiative (1995), Spotlight on the Schuykill (1995); and the construction of
                    Dinosaur Hall and the Discovering Dinosaurs exhibit. Other items in the
                    collection include a hardcopy printout of the Academy's web pages on Joseph
                    Leidy; audio tapes of radio spots (mostly by Howard Coffin), annual meetings,
                    and interviews 1983-1994; an oversize invitation to the Academy's "Night with
                    the Birds and Beasts" gala in 1968; correspondence and documents relating to
                    "Explorer Series" lecture and presentations, 1980-1982; and a press kit and
                    photos relating to the "Deinonyclus" sculpture. </p>
