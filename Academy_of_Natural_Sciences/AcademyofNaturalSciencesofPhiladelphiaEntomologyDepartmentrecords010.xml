                <p>Entomology has played a part in the Academy of Natural Sciences since its
                    founding in 1812. The department's collections currently contains more than
                    3,500,000 specimens of which more than 11,000 are primary types. The staff of

                <p>This is a collection of correspondence and other records of the Entomology
                    Department of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. The records date
                    from the 1940s to 1995, and include the correspondence of Harold J. Grant, David
                    C. Rentz, Michael Emsley, and H. Radclyffe Roberts, among others. The
                    correspondence discusses identification and exchange of specimens, taxonomy,
                    Academy business, and publications. Other records in the departmental files
                    include department reports, specimen catalogs, grant proposals, reports from
                    field work, and records of loans (1940s-1995). The papers of J.A.G. Rehn
                    constitute a significant portion of the collection. Rehn's papers include:
                    professional correspondence related to his research, exchange of specimens, and
                    issues of taxonomy; grant proposals for his work on "Taxonomic and Faunistic
                    Treatment of the Orthoptera of North America"; notebooks and field books,
                    listing type localities, specimens, and film exposures; and lantern slides of
                    field trips (landscapes, peoples, flora, and fauna) and insect specimens, taken
                    by Rehn, Morgan Hebard, and Milton Holmes. The collection also includes a
                    handmade booklet of photos of staff members of the Academy's Insect Department,
                    from 1966.</p>
