            <bioghist>
                <p>In honor of the nationâ€™s bicentennial, the Academy of Natural Sciences organized
                    a symposium on natural history. The symposium was held in April, 1976. Speakers
                    from the Academy and from other institutions made presentations on topics
                    ranging from changing ecosystems to evolutionary biology to population genetics.
                    Clyde Goulden was chairman of the Bicentennial Symposium Committee.</p>
