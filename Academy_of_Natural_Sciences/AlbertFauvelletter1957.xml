            <bioghist>
                <p>Charles Adolphe Albert Fauvel (1840-1921) was an attorney by profession who
                    dedicated much of his time to the study of entomology. He published many papers,
                    monographs, and catalogs. He was a noted expert on the family Staphylinidae. He
                    described 1851 species and 96 genera of Staphylinidae. In 1882 Fauvel founded,
                    in Caen, the journal Revue dâ€™Entomologie and edited it through 28 volumes until
                    1910. In 1910, without warning the subscribers or contributing authors, he
                    abruptly stopped publication of his journal, discontinued all connections,
                    withdrew entirely from scientific and public life, and stayed in seclusion until
                    his death in 1921. </p>
