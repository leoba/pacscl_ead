            <bioghist>
                <p>In 1948, long before water pollution and environmental degradation became topics
                    of public concern, the Academy established the Environmental Research Division.
                    This marked the beginning of a broadened research orientation for the Academy,
                    which included applied research in aquatic ecosystems as well as the traditional
                    systematics research--discovering and cataloguing organisms.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of records of the Division of Environmental Research of the
                    Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Many of the papers come from the
                    office of L.E. Sage, but correspondence of Ruth Patrick, and Roger Thomas can
                    also be found in the collection. Office records include:administrative
                    correspondence, 1960s-1980s; project proposals, planning documents, and reports;
                    contacts in business and industry, 1980s to 1995; maps; personnel evaluations;
                    site and space plans; publications, including copies of ANSP Environmental
                    Research Reports and Environmental Monitoring Studies; reprints of articles by
                    staff members; photocopies of newspaper publicity clippings 1948-1984; procedure
                    manuals; a proposal for a Delaware River Environmental Research and Education
                    Center; proceedings of the Schuylkill River Symposium (1980); and an oversize
                    architectural renderings of the Academy of Natural Sciences Estuarine Research
                    Facility in St. Leonard, Maryland. The collection also includes data sheets for
                    several projects from 1958 to 1979 and for the Potomac Electric Power Company
                    Chalk Point project from the mid 1970s to the 1980s.</p>
