                <p>John Dunning devoted the last twenty-five years of his life to obtaining and
                    making available to the public top quality photographs of as many of the bird
                    species of South America as he could find. About 30,000 of his slides are now on
                    deposit with Visual Resources for Ornithology (VIREO), a branch of the Academy
                    of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.</p>
