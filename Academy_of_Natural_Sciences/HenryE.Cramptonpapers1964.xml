            <bioghist>
                <p>Henry Edward Crampton (1875-1956) devoted most of his career to the study of the
                    land snail genus Partula. He made 12 expeditions to the Pacific islands
                    (spending most of his time on Tahiti, Moorea, and surrounding islands) and
                    published three monographs on the evolution, distribution, and variation of
                    Partula.</p>
