                <p>The Library Company of Philadelphia is an independent research library
                    concentrating on American society and culture from the 17th through 19th
                    centuries. It was founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin as a subscription library
                    supported by its shareholders, as it is to this day. Free and open to the
                    public, the Library Company houses an extensive non-circulating collection of
                    rare books, manuscripts, broadsides, ephemera, and works of art. </p>

                    Philadelphia in honor of its 250th anniversary. Most volumes are facsimile
                    editions of significant texts, and were sent to the Library Company from various

                    of talks given at the Quarter of a Millennium celebration, an attendee
                    information packet, two commemorative medals, and a small number of letters of
                    congratulation.</p>
