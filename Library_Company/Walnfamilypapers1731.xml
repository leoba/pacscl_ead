                <p>Robert Waln, state legislator and US Congressman from Philadelphia, officer of
                    several Philadelphia business and cultural organizations, began his business
                    career as a shipping merchant in 1785. In 1791 he formed a partnership with his
                    cousin Jesse Waln. Robert Waln withdrew from the firm in 1805, continuing once
                    again on his own.</p>
