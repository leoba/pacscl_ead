            <bioghist>
                <p>Samuel George Morton (1799-1851) was a physician and natural scientist. Morton
                    received his medical education at the University of Pennsylvania, and the
                    University of Edinburgh. He was an active member of the Academy of Natural
                    Sciences, serving as its president in 1850. He was a professor of anatomy at the
                    University of Pennsylvania from 1839 to 1843. Morton is most noted for his
                    craniometric studies of humans and his conclusions about the relative
                    intellectual capacities of the "five races." His work had a profound influence
                    on the development of physical anthropology in antebellum America. He also made
                    contributions in the fields of geology, mineralogy, paleontology, and natural
                    history.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>Mainly the papers of Samuel George Morton of Philadelphia, physician,
                    ethnologist, and professor of anatomy, Pennsylvania College. The papers are for
                    the years, 1832-1851, when Morton devoted his research efforts almost
                    exclusively to ethnology and to the collecting of human skulls for comparative
                    studies. Almost two-thirds of the papers consist of incoming correspondence,
                    1832-1851, relating to ethnology and such related interests as anthropology,
                    craniology, paleontology, and Egyptology. His collection of crania involved a
                    very extensive correspondence and many of the letters have to do with that
                    project. Correspondents include Asa Gray, Samuel S. Haldeman, William B.
                    Hodgson, Charles Lyell, and Benjamin Silliman, Jr. The remainder of Samuel
                    Morton's papers is made up of research notes and manuscript copies of lectures
                    and writings, including: "The origin and diversity of the human species";
                    "Inquiry into the distinctive characteristics of the Aboriginal race of
                    America"; "On the size of the brain in various races and families of man";
                    "Racial abilities and characteristics"; "The origin of the black skin
                    color"; "Cranial characteristics of Negroes"; "Hybridity in the human
                    race." Of special interest are notes relating to two technical works Morton
                    published based on his collection of crania: "Crania Americana" (1839) and
                    "Crania Aegyptiaca" (1844). There is also a printer's manuscript (incomplete)
                    of "Crania Americana"; and the Pennsylvania College, medical department,
                    minutes of faculty meetings and miscellaneous accounts, 1841-1843 (1 v.). The
                    collection contains a few papers of James St. Clair Morton (son of Samuel
                    Morton) who was an engineer as well as author of works on engineering and
                    fortifications. Papers include: letters to his father; records of Morton's
                    survey of the Isthmus of Chiriqui, Central America, 1860, among which are the
                    journal of the surveying party (1 v.) and field notes of Thomas Jekyll,
                    assistant to Morton (2 v.); letterpress book, 1862, regarding Fort Mifflin, Fort
                    Jefferson and other military matters; account books, 1862 (2 v.), kept while
                    Morton was chief engineer, Army of the Ohio.</p>
