            <bioghist>
                <p>Thomas Leiper (1745-1825) was born in Scotland and immigrated to Maryland in
                    1763. In 1765, he moved to Philadelphia and began a tobacco storage and export
                    business. In 1780, he purchased several quarries. He amassed a large fortune,
                    and contributed to improvements in Philadelphia, and in Delaware County, where
                    he made his home. He was one of the founders of the first troop of city light
                    horse, and served with them as Lieutenant during the Revolution in the battles
                    of Trenton, Brandywine, and Germantown. He was a staunch democrat and
                    participated in town meetings, and was a member, and eventually, president of
                    the city council. He was also the director of the Banks of Philadelphia and the
                    United States, and constructed the first permanent tramway in America.</p>
