            <bioghist>
                <p>Mary Rebecca Darby Smith (d. 1886) was the daughter of James and Hannah Logan
                    Smith, and the great great granddaughter of James Logan, statesman and secretary
                    to William Penn. In her will, Smith bequeathed her collection of books and
                    albums to the Loganian Library, which had been absorbed by the Library Company
                    of Philadelphia in 1792. Smith was the author of several books, including Brief
                    Memorials of Departed Worth, a memorial of her mother.</p>
