                <p>Most of the text in this undated commonplace book is in Latin. The few passages
                    written in English include "The Poetical Works of the Rev. Dr. E. Young, Vol.
                    II" and "The Miseries of Human Life," as well as miscellaneous notes. Other
                    topics include manufacturing and agricultural opportunities in Philadelphia as
                    well as trade in chinaware and the production of silk. From the dates of these
                    cited sources, the volume appears to have been written in the late 18th
                    century.</p>
