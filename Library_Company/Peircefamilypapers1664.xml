                <p>The first volume mostly contains poetry by Phebe Peirce as well as extracts from
                    the work of other poets. Phebe completed the book in 1821 when she was 17 years
                    old. The poems are often accompanied by lovely calligraphy and discuss life,
                    death, friendship, and other philosophical and sentimental matters. Page 1
                    features the quote, "Reading improves the mind." The second volume, created by
                    Rebecca Peirce between 1825 and 1830, is entitled "The Remembrancer." The book
                    has printed illustrations, many of them in color. It includes poetry, apparently
                    none of it by Rebecca but some of it by her sister Phebe. The poetry concerns
                    friendship, cottages, nature, and other things of beauty.</p>
