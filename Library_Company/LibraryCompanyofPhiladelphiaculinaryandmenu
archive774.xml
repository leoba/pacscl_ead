            <bioghist>
                <p>The Library Company of Philadelphia is an independent research library
                    concentrating on American society and culture from the 17th through 19th
                    centuries. It was founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin as a subscription library
                    supported by its shareholders, as it is to this day. Free and open to the
                    public, the Library Company houses an extensive non-circulating collection of
                    rare books, manuscripts, broadsides, ephemera, and works of art. </p>

                <p>This is a collection of culinary ephemera. Items in the collection include menus,
                    advertisements, brochures, flyers, cookbooks (promotional), advertising and
                    business cards, and magazines. The materials are largely related to
                    Philadelphia, though items from Maine, Wisconsin, and California are also
                    present. </p>
