                <p>This volume appears to be the journal of a blacksmith who worked in the central
                    Pennsylvania area during the second quarter of the 19th century. Entries that
                    imply the blacksmith trade include "1 ax drest," "1 shovel mendet," "steelt
                    shou," and "1 hoe sharpt." It also appears that this artisan bartered for his
                    services, accepting as payment bushels of wheat and other similar commodities.
                    The location for many of the entries dated 1838 and 1839 is Boalsburg (Centre
                    County, Pa.), while the location for later entries, 1840-41, is Gaysport (Blaire
                    County, Pa.) A furnace began operating in Gaysport in 1836 which might explain
                    this artisan's apparent relocation. Several years after this blacksmith
                    relocated, a foundry began operating in Gaysport as well in 1846.</p>
