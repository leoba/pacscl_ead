            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated through an act of the state legislature, the Pennsylvania Female
                    College opened in Harrisburg on September 5, 1853. The aim of the school, the
                    first of its kind in the state, was to provide "the liberal education of
                    Females in the various branches of Science, Literature and the learned and
                    foreign languages.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The volume represents the first years of the college, recording grades for the
                    years 1853-1856. The records include student's names, daily marks, subjects and
                    sometimes final marks. From the name inscribed on the front of the first page,
                    this record was originally kept by Mrs. C.D.S. Getz, 1853-1854. Getz was the
                    principal female teacher. Another name inscribed on the back of the first page
                    reads Mademoiselle Banmartz [?] 1854-1855, who most likely was the teacher for
                    that time period.</p>
