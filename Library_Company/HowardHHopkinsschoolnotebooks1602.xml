                <p>These four volumes contain the notes of Howard H. Hopkins while a student at an
                    unidentified institution during the early 1830s. The subjects covered by these
                    notebooks are single bookkeeping, double bookkeeping, geometry and architecture.
                    All contain ornate lettering of the subject headings as well as some carefully
                    drawn and painted geometric and architectural figures. Included in the single
                    bookkeeping notebook is a commencement address describing Hopkins' reflections
                    of his school experiences. Although Hopkins never notes the name of this
                    institution, it may have been a boarding school type based on his description of
                    the place as an "interesting village" where he received much attention and
                    affection for two years.</p>
