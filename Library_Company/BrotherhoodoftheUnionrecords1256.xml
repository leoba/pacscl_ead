            <bioghist>
                <p>George Lippard (1822-1854) was a 19th century American novelist, journalist,
                    playwright, social activist, and labor organizer. In 1850 Lippard founded the
                    Brotherhood of the Union, a secret benevolent society with rituals and symbols
                    drawn from the Masons and Odd-Fellows. The organization was later renamed the
                    Brotherhood of America; it dissolved in 1995. </p>

                    142 of the Brotherhood of the Union; printed circulars and broadsides;
                    manuscript letters from Lippard to William Macfarlane and James Stevens; and two
                    volumes: Lippard's Diary (1852-1869), which contains Lippard's notes about the
                    Brotherhood from 1852 to 1854, and which was continued by Lippard's successors
                    as a record-book of the Supreme Washington; and a record book (1859-1879), which
                    includes minutes, resolutions, by-laws, and financial records. The collection
