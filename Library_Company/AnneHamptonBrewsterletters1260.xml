            <bioghist>
                <p>Anne Hampton Brewster (1819-1892) was a Philadelphia-born novelist, journalist,
                    and foreign correspondent. She lived in Rome beginning in 1868 and wrote
                    articles about Italian art, architecture, archaeology, political events, and
                    social gossip, until about 1888.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of letters from Anne Hampton Brewster to Mary F. Howell
                    between 1854 and 1874. In the letters written when both women were in
                    Philadelphia (1854-1856), Brewster discusses her grief over her mother's death
                    and her resentment of her father, as well as the two correspondents' shared
                    interest in literature, music, art, and religion. There are letters written to
                    Howell when Brewster was in Vevay, Switzerland (1857-1858). In these she
                    discusses studying French and Italian and describes her daily life and travels.
                    Another series contains letters written from Bridgeton, New Jersey (1858-1868),
                    when Brewster was writing and teaching French and music to children. These
                    letters discuss her literary work and her financial situation. They also reveal
                    her Copperhead views. There is one final letter from Rome in 1874 in which she
                    describes her social life and interactions with artists and writers there. The
                    collection also includes a small batch of letters of L.H. Carpenter and J.E.
                    Carpenter between 1872 and 1888.</p>
