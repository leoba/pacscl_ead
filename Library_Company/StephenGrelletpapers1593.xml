            <bioghist>
                <p>Born and educated in France, Grellet came to Philadelphia in 1795, was accepted
                    into the Society of Friends, and admitted as an itinerant minister in 1798. In
                    1823 he moved to Burlington. During his four trips abroad from 1807 to 1843,
                    visiting France, Great Britain, Russia, Scandinavia, and other countries,
                    Grellet was concerned not only with spiritual matters but also with social
                    improvements, particularly abolition of slavery, prison reforms, and education
                    of the poor.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>These papers of Stephen Grellet, Quaker minister, relate primarily to his
                    missions throughout Europe. His activities are described through extracts in an
                    unknown hand from letters to his wife (4 vols.) and occasional reports to
                    Meetings. The main portion of the papers consists of incoming correspondence
                    from Friends whom Grellet met on his missions. Among the authors of these
                    pietistic epistles are Peter Bedford, Lucy Bradshaw, Josiah Forster, George
                    Gessler, Johannes Gossner, Af Kothen, Louis Majolier, J. A. Mollet, Martha
                    Ussher, and John Venning. Grellet's major correspondent is British
                    philanthropist William Allen with whom Grellet shared humanitarian interests and
                    sometimes traveled. Allen's letters are more substantial records of the
                    activities of European Quakers. Also included is "memorandum kept by L[ucy]
                    Bradshaw during the last illness of William Allen," 1834. In addition, there
                    are letters form Grellet's father Gabriel Grellet, brothers Joseph and Charles,
                    and other family members. There are a few of the reports, 1818, which Grellet
                    wrote at the request of host sovereigns concerning social conditions of their
                    countries, including a lengthy communication to Alexander I of Russia. Some of
                    the correspondence and reports are in French or German.</p>
