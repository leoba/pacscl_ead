            <bioghist>
                <p>Robert Aitken (1735-1802) was born in Scotland but from 1771 made Philadelphia
                    his home. He was a printer, publisher, bookseller and engraver. His outstanding
                    work was the "Aitken Bible," (1782), first complete English Bible printed in
                    America. Also published "Aitken's General American Register," (1773), and
                    "Pennsylvania Magazine", (1775-1776).</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>One volume, a ledger, is the least interesting, in that it is a brief record of
                    accounts, in many cases incomplete, covering 1777-1802. However, the accounts do
                    present a fascinating array of names, merchant houses, and even churches
                    carrying accounts with Aitkin. The second volume, a waste book for 1771-1802,
                    provides a record of Atikin's daily business.</p>
