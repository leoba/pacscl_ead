                <p>These materials comprise the lists of subscribers in Philadelphia in 1840 to the
                    purchase of the Automaton Chess-Player. The Automaton was the invention of
                    Wolfgang de Kempelen, a Hungarian. According to a notation made in the one
                    notebook of this collection, the amount to be raised for the purchase of this
                    invention was $500. The minimum accepted subscription was to be five dollars
                    because it was "desirable to have as few present as possible, when the secret
                    is to be explored."</p>
