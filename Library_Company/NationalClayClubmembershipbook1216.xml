            <bioghist>
                <p>The National Clay Club was an organization of the supporters of Henry Clay for
                    the presidential election of 1844. There were many local chapters of the Clay
                    Club in townships and cities throughout Pennsylvania and in other states. Some
                    of the local chapters corresponded with the National Clay Club to report on
                    their organizing activities and membership recruitment.</p>
