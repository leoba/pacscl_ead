            <bioghist>
                <p>Charles Butler was a prominent English Catholic figure who campaigned actively
                    for Catholic Emancipation. In addition to his professional career as a
                    conveyancer and his political activities, Butler was also a prolific writer on a
                    variety of subjects such as law, history, music, English, Scottish and Irish
                    Catholic history, and Holy Scripture.</p>
