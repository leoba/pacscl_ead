                <p>Humphrey Morrey (1650-1716) was the first mayor of Philadelphia, serving from
                    1691 to 1701. He had substantial real estate holdings in Cheltenham Township and
                    in the city, including the greater portion of the block bounded by Front,
                    Second, Chestnut, and Water Streets. Upon his death, his son Richard (d. 1754)
                    and his grandson Humphrey (d. 1735) inherited his properties. Richard Morrey and
                    his first wife Ann had a son, Thomas, who also died in 1735.</p>
