                <p>The volume contains minutes and extracts of letters of the Philadelphia chapter
                    of the State Relief Association for East Tennessee. The Confederate Army had
                    occupied the Union stronghold of East Tennessee, and many of the Union
                    sympathizers of that area were struggling to survive. Concerned citizens
                    throughout the North, including those represented in this volume, gathered
                    together funds to help support the people of East Tennessee, including those who
                    were living as refugees in Nashville.</p>
