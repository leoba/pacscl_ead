            <bioghist>
                <p>Samuel George Morton (1799-1851) was a physician and natural scientist. Morton
                    received his medical education at the University of Pennsylvania, and the
                    University of Edinburgh. He was an active member of the Academy of Natural
                    Sciences, serving as its president in 1850. He was a professor of anatomy at the
                    University of Pennsylvania from 1839 to 1843. Morton is most noted for his
                    craniometric studies of humans and his conclusions about the relative
                    intellectual capacities of the "five races." His work had a profound influence
                    on the development of physical anthropology in antebellum America. He also made
                    contributions in the fields of geology, mineralogy, paleontology, and natural
                    history.</p>
