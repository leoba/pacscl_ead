                <p>The collection includes two manuscript volumes. One volume contains poems as well
                    as reflections, vignettes, and other prose writings by Mary Norris and her
                    sister, Sarah, with annotations by Mary's daughter S[ally] N[orris] Dickinson.
                    The other volume contains letters between Hannah Griffitts ("Fidellia"),
                    Hannah Harrison ("Sophronia"), and Mary Norris ("Sophia"). These girls gave
                    the people and places in their lives code names and use them to describe some
                    seemingly ordinary events in fairy-tale fashion. Other names mentioned in the
                    volume, such as Theophilus and Fellicia, refer to other members of the Norris
                    and Logan families. This volume appears to be a copy of the original, perhaps
                    made by the daughter of "Sophia" and contains a brief introduction about "The
                    Rural Circle, or Band of Friendship, in familiar letters between several young
                    ladies, Interspers'd with a variety of valuable characters," which may be the
                    title of the volume. The volume contains annotations by Sally Norris Dickinson
                    and an endnote by Dickeison explains the characters and the volume, which was
                    meant as a testament to the girls' friendship.</p>
