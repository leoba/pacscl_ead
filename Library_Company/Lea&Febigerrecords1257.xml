                <p>Mathew Carey (1760-1839) founded Mathew Carey &amp; Co. in 1785. The firm went on
                    to become Philadelphia's most successful publishing house, printing the works of
                    Thomas Jefferson, Parson Weems, Walter Scott, James Fenimore Cooper, and the
                    first quarto Bible of American manufacture, then moving on to specialize in
                    scientific and medical publication by the late 1830s. The firm changed its name
                    a number of times. It became M. Carey &amp; Son in 1817, when Mathew's son,
                    Henry C. Carey, joined the firm. In 1821, Carey's son-in-law, Isaac Lea joined
                    the firm and it became M. Carey &amp; Sons. The senior Carey retired in 1824,
                    and shortly thereafter the partnership became Carey, Lea &amp; Carey, when
                    younger son Edward L. Carey joined the firm. In 1829, Edward Carey withdrew to
                    form a bookselling partnership with Abraham Hart. In 1833, William A. Blanchard
                    became a partner and the firm became, briefly, Carey, Lea &amp; Blanchard. In
                    1836, Henry C. Carey retired and the firm was known as Lea &amp; Blanchard until
                    1851. That year Isaac Lea withdrew in favor of his son, Henry Charles Lea, and
                    the firm became Blanchard &amp; Lea, which it remained until Blanchard's
                    retirement in 1865. Thereafter, the firm bore only the Lea name until 1907 when
                    Lea's sons joined with Christian Febiger to form the partnership of Lea &amp;
                    Febiger. The company was sold to Waverly, Inc. in 1990. </p>
