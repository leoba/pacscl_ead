                <p>This unidentified volume appears to be an inventory of an individual's collection
                    or institution's holdings. Formatted as an index, it lists hundreds of
                    engravings alphabetically by title or subject. Also noted with each entry is the
                    printer, engraver and remarks. While a variety of subjects is represented, from
                    British statesmen to battle scenes of the American Revolution, there appears to
                    be an emphasis on French categories, including separate lists of kings and
                    marshals of France. In addition, the list of images of Napoleon is so extensive,
                    it is divided into subcategories, such as caricature and allegorical. Within the
                    volume (and a possible link to its compiler), is an ink blotter printed with an
                    advertisement for Philadelphia printer and publisher Lehman &amp; Bolton. Based
                    on the paper and soft leather cover, the volume appears to date from the late
                    19th to early 20th century.</p>
