            <bioghist>
                <p>Udney Maria Blakeley was the daughter of Johnston and Jane Blakeley of
                    Wilmington, North Carolina. Her father, a naval hero of the War of 1812, was
                    lost at sea at the end of the war. Jane Blakeley was remarried in 1817 to Dr.
                    Robert Abbot of Christiansted, St. Croix, and Maria was sent to school in
                    Philadelphia. She finished her education in 1828, and joined her mother and
                    stepfather in St. Croix, where she met Baron Joseph von Bretton, whom she
                    married in 1841. She died the following year in childbirth.</p>
