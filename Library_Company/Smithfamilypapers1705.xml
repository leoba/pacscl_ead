                <p>Section A (14 volumes and one box w/unpublished calendar for 12 of the vols.):
                    John Smith, a member of a Quaker family of Burlington, New Jersey, came to
                    Philadelphia in 1743 where he soon became a successful merchant in trade with
                    the West Indies and London. During his residence in the city, he was active in
                    civic affairs and served in the Pennsylvania Assembly, 1750-1752. In 1756 he
                    retired to the family residence in Burlington. John Jay Smith, grandson of John
                    Smith, first entered into business in 1818 with Solomon Temple as a wholesale
                    drug merchant. The partnership ended in 1821, and after some further small
                    efforts in commercial ventures, Smith's principal activity was in the literary
                    field. He published Pennsylvania Gazette, 1827-1829, edited Waldie's Circulating
                    Library, 1832-1845, Horticulturist, 1855-1860, and a variety of other literary,
                    historical, and horticultural periodicals and books. From 1829 to 1851, Smith
                    was Librarian of the Library Company of Philadelphia. He was an organizer and
                    treasurer of the Athenian Institute, a group which arranged a series of public
                    lectures. In 1850, Smith led efforts to bring portions of the London Exposition
                    of Art and Industry to the United States. He was a founder and promoter of
                    Laurel Hill Cemetery through which he developed an interest in landscape
                    gardening. John Jay's mother's family is also represented in the family papers,
                    mostly in regard to the management of the Richard Hill estate property by son
                    Henry Hill and son-in-laws Samuel Preston Moore. Henry also took over his
                    father's wine and commission business in Madeira which he carried on with his
                    other brothers in-law Robert Bisset and Thomas Lamar. The earliest portion of
                    these papers consists of sermons, epistles, testimonies, and other documents
                    relating to the Society of Friends. Correspondence to John Smith in
                    Philadelphia, primarily from his father Richard in Burlington, concerns both
                    business and family matters. Later correspondence to John, after his return to
                    Burlington, comes from Philadelphia Friends, William Logan chief among them,
                    reporting on public and family affairs. There are Samuel Preston Moore and Henry
                    Hill deeds, survey warrants, leases, releases, etc., including copies relating
                    to the original William Penn land grants. Late 18th-century manuscripts are
                    letters, bills, invoices, to Henry Hill concerning Hill, Lamar, &amp; Bisset's
                    wine exportation from Madeira to America and London, as well as other mercantile
                    and family business. The last section of the Smith family papers is
                    correspondence to John Jay Smith, particularly from John Fanning Watson about
                    historical matters; George Taylor on publishing the Pennsylvania Gazette; G. A.
                    Shryock on paper manufacture; Dionysius Larnder on his U.S. lecture tour; A. J.
                    Downing on horticulture, and miscellaneous correspondents concerning the London
                    Exposition. Section B: John Smith manuscripts include accounts of personal
                    business finances, 1743-77: wastebooks (4 v.), journal, ledgers (2 v.), invoice
                    books--inward (2 v.); Smith's accounts with John Pole, 1763-71, and with Abel
                    James, 1764; and other account books. John Smith's diaries, 1738-52, report
                    primarily on meetings of the Friends, weather, and his social activities,
                    particularly his courtship of Hannah Logan. Only occasional remarks on business
                    and public affairs are made. Smith also made extensive notes of biographical and
                    bibliographical information on Quaker ministers (2 v.). This section also
                    includes Samuel Preston Moore's personal receipt books, 1758-81, as well as
                    Pennsylvania provincial accounts, 1758-64, while he was serving as Provincial
                    Treasurer. Henry Hill's account books, 1763-75 (2 v.), record mostly business
                    transactions with Hill Lamar &amp; Bisset, while his receipt books, 1788-1802 (2
                    v.) are mainly personal. There are College of Philadelphia accounts, 1789-91,
                    Henry Hill, Treasurer. Deeds, leases, releases, powers of attorney and other
                    documents relate to family property, mostly in Philadelphia and Bucks Counties.
                    Section C: The bulk of this group of papers are of 19th century Smiths. John Jay
                    Smith pays court to his future wife Rachel Pearsall in a series of letters,
                    1820-21 (40 items); letters, 1850-51 (150 items), to him concern the efforts to
                    bring the London exposition to Philadelphia or New York. There is some incoming
                    correspondence on miscellaneous subjects. Horace John Smith, John Jay's son, was
                    a man with occasional careers. During the Civil War, he was a member of the U.S.
                    Christian Commission. He was a partner in a China business through the 1860's
                    and in the following decade he was a general manager and treasurer of West
                    Laurel Hill Cemetery. Much of his time was spent traveling in the American West
                    and Europe. In his later years he and his wife settled in England. His papers
                    are highly miscellaneous and only touch on his various activities. They include:
                    letters to his wife Margaret Longstreth Smith giving some information on his
                    work with the Christian Commission; incoming correspondence; personal and
                    business accounts, especially for West Laurel Hill Cemetery; memoranda;
                    scrapbooks. Among other family manuscripts are John Smith commonplace books (3
                    v.); Hannah Smith diary, 1775-76, chronicling activities of NJ Society of
                    Friends; letters of various family members touring Europe at various times;
                    Elizabeth P. Smith notes and lessons for her Bible class, 1871-81; scattered
                    letters of Logans and Pearsalls; poetry albums; and memorabilia.</p>
