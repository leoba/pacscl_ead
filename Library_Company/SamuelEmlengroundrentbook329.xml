                <p>This is a volume of ground rents, probably belonging to Samuel Emlen, for various
                    properties in and around Philadelphia for the years 1837 and 1838. Renters
                    included individuals, such as Horace Binney, Jr. and Samuel Chubb, as well as
                    churches and businesses, such as the African Episcopal Church, Friends Asylum,
                    and St. Thomas' African Church. The volume also lists dividends and loan
                    payments made to Emlen or his estate.</p>
