            <bioghist>
                <p>Edwin Wolf 2nd (1911-1991) was a librarian, bibliophile, author, historian,
                    Franklin scholar, and civic leader. He was the Curator of the Library Company of
                    Philadelphia from 1953 to 1955, and its Librarian from 1955 to 1984. Wolf
                    graduated from the William Penn Charter School and then studied at the Bedales
                    School in England. Wolf's father was a founding partner of a prominent
                    Philadelphia law firm, and was friends with Abraham Simon Wolf Rosenbach (d.
                    1952). Upon his return from England, Edwin Wolf went to work for Dr. Rosenbach.
                    Wolf served in the army during the second World War. After Dr. Rosenbach's death
                    in 1952, Wolf joined the Library Company as a consultant and advisor. Wolf's
                    publications include A History of the Jews of Philadelphia from Colonial Times
                    to the Age of Jackson, Rosenbach: A Biography, and The Library of James Logan of
                    Philadelphia, 1674-1751. He was a member of the American Philosophical Society,
                    and received the Philadelphia Award in 1982 for his decades of service to the
                    city. </p>
