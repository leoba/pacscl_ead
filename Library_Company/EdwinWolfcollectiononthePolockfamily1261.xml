            <bioghist>
                <p>Edwin Wolf 2nd (1911-1991) was a librarian, bibliophile, author, historian,
                    Franklin scholar, and civic leader. He was the Curator of the Library Company of
                    Philadelphia from 1953 to 1955, and its Librarian from 1955 to 1984. Wolf's
                    publications include A History of the Jews of Philadelphia from Colonial Times
                    to the Age of Jackson, Rosenbach: A Biography, and The Library of James Logan of
                    Philadelphia, 1674-1751. Hyman Polock (1786-1870) was a merchant of watches and
                    jewelry in Philadelphia. He had three sons: Solomon (b. 1813), Barnett
                    (1815-1849), and Lewis (1819-1851). All three of them traveled to the western
                    United States. Solomon worked for a time in Galveston as a butcher. Barnett was
                    a watchmaker who did business in Western Pennsylvania, as well as New Orleans,
                    Galveston, and Alabama. Lewis went to San Francisco, where he sold clothing and
                    textiles and worked as a tailor. He was also, for a short time, a gold
                    prospector.</p>
