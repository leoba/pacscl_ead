            <bioghist>
                <p>The Centennial International Exhibition of 1876, the first official World's Fair
                    in the United States, was held in Philadelphia to celebrate the 100th
                    anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. It was officially
                    called the International Exhibition of Arts, Manufactures and Products of the
                    Soil and Mine. It was held in Fairmount Park, along the Schuylkill River, in
                    fairgrounds designed by Hermann Schwarzmann. About 10 million visitors attended
                    the exhibition during its six month run.</p>
