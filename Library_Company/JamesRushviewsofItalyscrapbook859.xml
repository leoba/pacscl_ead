            <bioghist>
                <p>James Rush (1786-1869) was the seventh child of Dr. Benjamin Rush and Julia
                    Stockton. Rush studied at both Princeton University and at the University of
                    Edinburgh. After returning to Philadelphia, he obtained his M.D. from the
                    University of Pennsylvania in 1809. In 1813, Rush was appointed Treasurer of the
                    United States Mint, a post he held until 1830. In 1819 James Rush married Phoebe
                    Anne Ridgway (1799-1857), daughter of the wealthy Philadelphia merchant Jacob
                    Ridgway (1768-1843). He retired from public life after only a short time to
                    peruse his literary and scientific interests. After his death, James Rush left
                    his estate to found the Ridgway Branch of the Library Company of
                    Philadelphia.</p>
