                <p>John Fitch's autobiography (1 1/2 v.) and recollections of the proceedings
                    "respecting the steam boat" (3 1/2 v.) were both written from 1790 to 1791 at
                    the request of the Rev. Nathaniel Irwin. The autobiographical account touches on
                    all his activities but mentions particularly his years as an apprentice, his
                    captivity with the Indians and the British, and his entanglement in the affair
                    between his business partner Henry Voight and Mary Kraft. Fitch's account of his
                    development of the steamboat details his efforts to gain financial support and
                    to secure patents. There is also an address, 1791 (1 v.), to the Commissioners
                    of Congress for granting Exclusive Rights defending his invention claim,
                    especially against James Rumsey.</p>
