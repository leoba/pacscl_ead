            <bioghist>
                <p>Samuel Breck (1747-1809) was a wealthy merchant in Boston; in 1792, he moved with
                    his family to Philadelphia where he became a director of the First Bank of the
                    United States and was active in local and national affairs. Breck--in
                    partnership with John Green-- acted as a fiscal agent for the French fleet in
                    American waters during the Revolution.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection contains correspondence of Samuel Breck, his son Samuel Breck,
                    Jr. (1771-1862) and John Ross 1726-1800, Samuel Breck Jr.'s father-in-law and a
                    Philadelphia shipping merchant). Correspondence, 1780-1789, mostly in French
                    from French officials and commanders, deals with supplies, and, after the War,
                    indicates continuing friendship. After the move to Philadelphia, the senior
                    Breck entered into a mercantile partnership. Later correspondence in the
                    collection reveals the family's wide acquaintance with American public figures
                    such as Henry Clay, William Bingham, and Peter S. DuPonceau. The correspondence
                    is more political than commercial.</p>
