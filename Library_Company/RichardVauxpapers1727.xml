            <bioghist>
                <p>Richard Vaux held a number of local and federal offices, including secretary to
                    the Legation at London, Comptroller of Public Schools, and Mayor of
                    Philadelphia.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>These papers are mostly from Vaux's term as Philadelphia Recorder, a judicial
                    office in which he served from 1841 to 1847, and where he established a record
                    in that not one of his decisions was ever reversed by the higher courts. The
                    papers concern 21 police cases in the Recorder's office during 1840-42,
                    including affadavits, commitments, extradition warrants, bailments, and other
                    material. There are also five items dealing with the state constitution enacted
                    January 1, 1874 and its relation to the city of Philadelphia.</p>
