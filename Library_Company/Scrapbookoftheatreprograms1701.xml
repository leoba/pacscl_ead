                <p>This unidentified scrapbook consists of theatre program clippings noting play or
                    opera title and cast. With some entries, images of cast members, probably also
                    cut out of the programs, are pasted opposite the clipping. A handwritten entry
                    above every clipping notes the theatre and performance date. Also recorded are
                    the names of individuals. Since these names do not match any of the cast
                    members, perhaps these are the individuals who accompanied the scrapbook
                    compiler to these performances. Some of the handwritten names are also informal,
                    such as mamma and papa. Most of the programs are of Philadelphia theatres, such
                    as the Broad Street Theater and the Academy of Music, and a few are of New York
                    City theatres.</p>
