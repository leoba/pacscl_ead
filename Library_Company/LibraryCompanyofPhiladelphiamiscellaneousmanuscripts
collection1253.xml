                <p>The Library Company of Philadelphia is an independent research library
                    concentrating on American society and culture from the 17th through 19th
                    centuries. It was founded in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin as a subscription library
                    supported by its shareholders, as it is to this day. Free and open to the
                    public, the Library Company houses an extensive non-circulating collection of
                    rare books, manuscripts, broadsides, ephemera, and works of art. </p>

                    dating from 1846 to 1898. Items include: receipts, many with the names Isaac L.
                    Williams and Anna E. Williams; bill heads and blank bank drafts; correspondence,

                    pages); fragments of printed volumes, including several pages of a German humor
                    magazine, poems, and almanac pages; and commencement programs, concert programs,
                    and other announcements from Ingham University (1885-87). The collection also
                    includes a brochure about the 1999 Connecticut Charter Oak Quarter (with a
