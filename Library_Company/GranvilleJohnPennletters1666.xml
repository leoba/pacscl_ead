                <p>The collection consists of a scrapbook containing Granville John Penn letters to
                    John Jay Smith concerning personal and family affairs, accounts of his travel
                    during his visits to the United States, Penn lands in Pennsylvania, and William
                    Penn memorabilia. There are some additional Penn family and Smith family notes,
                    letters, reprints of a pamphlet on the Penn family by John Jay Smith, and
                    photographs of Smith and of Tempsford, the English estate of Penn family
                    descendent Dugald Stuart. Granville John Penn, great grandson of William Penn,
                    came to the U.S. in November 1851 to settle certain business and property
                    affairs of the Penn family. Several years prior to this, he had renewed his
                    correspondence with John Jay Smith for whom Penn had the highest respect and
                    affection. The bulk of Penn's letters were written during his two visits to
                    America (1851-1853 and 1857-1858) and provide not only an itinerary of Penn's
                    business trips but a clue to the extent of the Penn interests still unsettled. A
                    much smaller number of letters were sent from England--from Brampton and
                    Pennsylvania Castle, Portland.</p>
