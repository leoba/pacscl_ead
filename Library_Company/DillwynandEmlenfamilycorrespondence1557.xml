                <p>Correspondence between William Dillwyn of London and his daughter Sarah Logan
                    Dillwyn, and between Dillwyn and his daughter and son-in-law, Samuel Emlen, of
                    Burlington County, NJ, after their marriage in 1795. Letters are frequent,
                    cordial, and deal primarily with family matters and kin. Nevertheless, there is
                    frequent comment concerning such topics as yellow fever, abolitionism and
                    slavery, American and European politics, including the Napoleonic wars, the
                    embargo as well as their effects upon trade and merchants in Philadelphia and
                    London.</p>
