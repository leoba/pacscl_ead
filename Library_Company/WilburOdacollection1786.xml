            <bioghist>
                <p>Dr. Wilbur H. Oda (1892â€“1953), was a collector of German-Americana and a
                    colleague of Alfred L. Shoemaker. He was head of the Department of Modern
                    Languages at Germantown Academy, and later joined the staff of the Perkiomen
                    School at Pennsburg. While at the Germantown Academy he also served as president
                    of the Germantown Historical Society. In 1989, a bibliography of monographs and
                    almanacs printed in the German language between 1728 and 1830 was published
                    based on Oda's studies and those of the 19th century scholar Oswald
                    Seidensticker.</p>
