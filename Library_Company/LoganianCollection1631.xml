                <p>Most of the volumes in this collection are the notes of William Logan Jr. from
                    lectures on medicine and philosophy during his study in Edinburgh in 1769.
                    Medical journals include notes of Barton's "Materia medica," Black's
                    "Chemistry," William Cullen's lectures on physiology, Alexander Monro's
                    lectures on anatomy and Thomas Young's lectures on midwifery. Other medical
                    journals include a "History of Fevers," and Logan's notes on infirmary
                    clinical cases in which he details the symptoms and treatments of specific
                    individuals. Philosophical journals include "A Course of Lectures on Rhetoric
                    and Belles Lettres," two manuscript volumes of a five-volume series, written by
                    Hugh Blair, first regius professor of rhetoric and belles lettres at Edinburgh.
                    Transcribed in Latin are Logan's philosophical journals of "Commentarius in
                    Aristotelis Philosophiam" and "Commentarius in Aristotelis Physicam." Also
                    included is one volume belonging to the elder William Logan, M.D. of Bristol,
                    England (d. 1757). Although the spine title reads "de Fermentation," the
                    volume contains notes in Latin on animal locomotion, fevers and their effects as
                    well as extensive student notes on the foundation of logic and natural
                    philosophy. Begun in 1707, the journal is continued by Logan in English with
                    patient case histories, 1713-14. Other volumes include "An Ironical Panegyrick
                    on Drunkenness," n.d., Speeches in the House of Commons, 1640, and a
                    Biographical Memoir of Arnold of Brescia, Rienzi, Savonaroloa, Ximenes, and Fra
                    Paolo, n.d.</p>
