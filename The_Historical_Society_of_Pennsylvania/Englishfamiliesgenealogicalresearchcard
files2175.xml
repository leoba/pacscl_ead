                <p>The collection consists of card files of genealogical information on various
                    English individuals and families from the 15th-19th centuries. These materials
                    may have been compiled by someone researching the Johnson family. Grouped by
                    family name, the cards list names, births, deaths, marriages, and children,
                    though not all information is listed for all people. Family names include Downe,
                    Freeman, Hall, Johnson, Selby, and Stokes. Sources are often not cited, but it
                    appears that much of the information has been extracted from parish
                    registers.</p>
