            <bioghist>
                <p>John Early Ayars (1832-1920?). Licensed to preach probably in the Methodist
                    Church. He was educated as a minister in Illinois, but moved to Philadelphia in
                    1864.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection consists of diaries of John Early Ayars of Philadelphia,
                    Pennsylvania, written between 1881-1920. In one of the diaries Ayars indicates
                    that he kept these journals as "both a means of grace and preventive from
                    backsliding." Entries concern his faith (and crises of faith) and activities in
                    his community and the larger religious sphere. He also comments on literature,
                    politics, and world events, such as the Philippine American War, events in Cuba,
                    South Africa and Turkey, and urban development in the United States. There are
                    also some summaries of readings Ayars did on scientific topics and quotes from
                    preachings he found inspirational.</p>
