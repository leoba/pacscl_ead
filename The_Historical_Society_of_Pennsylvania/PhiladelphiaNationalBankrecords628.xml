            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia National Bank (PNB) was the direct successor of The Philadelphia
                    Bank, organized on August 3, 1803 and chartered on March 5, 1804. Its early
                    board of directors included many of the city's successful merchants and
                    businessmen who were not part of the traditional elite and identified themselves
                    as Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans rather than Federalists. Its original
                    building at 4th and Chestnut Streets was designed by Benjamin H. Latrobe. The
                    Philadelphia Bank grew steadily during the 19th century as Philadelphia became a
                    major industrial and railroad center. It was reorganized as the Philadelphia
                    National Bank on October 20, 1864, under the National Banking Act of 1863. In
                    the 20th century PNB grew substantially by merger and acquisition. Absorbed
                    banks included the Farmers &amp; Mechanics Bank, Girard National, Franklin
                    National, Chester National Bank and Commercial National Bank of Philadelphia. In
                    1986 PNB was absorbed into the CORESTATES financial group.</p>
