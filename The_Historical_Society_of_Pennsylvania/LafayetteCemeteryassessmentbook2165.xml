                <p>Lafayette Cemetery was a non-sectarian cemetery originally located at 10th and
                    Wharton Street in Philadelphia. It was incorporated in 1838. In 1946, all of the
                    remains were removed to Evergreen Memorial Park, near Langhorne in Bucks County,
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
