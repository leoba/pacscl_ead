            <bioghist>
                <p>Sumiko Kobayashi was born in Florida, the daughter of Japanese immigrants. Her
                    family was relocated from San Leandro, California under Executive Order 9066 and
                    interned in the Topaz Relocation Center in Utah. Sumiko was allowed to leave the
                    camp in order to attend college through the help of the National Japanese
                    American Student Relocation Council, and graduated from Brothers College, Drew
                    University in Madison, New Jersey in 1946. She has been active in many
                    Japanese-American and Asian-American organizations and served as Redress Chair
                    for Pennsylvania of the Japanese American Citizens' League's National Committee
                    on Redress.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>These papers document Kobayashi's work with and interest in a large number of
                    Japanese American and Asian American Organizations, including the Japanese
                    American Citizens League, Japanese Christina Church, Seabrook Educational and
                    Cultural Center, and the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund. The
