            <bioghist>
                <p>Anthony Joseph Drexel Biddle, Jr. (1896-1961) was very active in Democratic
                    politics, including serving as associate secretary of the Democratic National
                    Convention in 1936. His activity in the political arena led to several
                    appointments as a diplomatic officer. He served as minister to Norway, 1935-37,
                    and ambassador to Poland, (1937-Sept. 9, 1939). After the invasion of Poland by
                    the Germans, Biddle accompanied the Polish government to France, where he served
                    as interim ambassador to France and A. E. and P of the United States to the
                    governments of Poland, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway, Greece, Yugoslavia,
                    Czechoslovakia, and the M. E. and P to Luxembourg. He resigned from diplomatic
                    service in 1944, and then served in various positions such as adjutant general
                    (with rank of major general) to Pennsylvania.</p>
