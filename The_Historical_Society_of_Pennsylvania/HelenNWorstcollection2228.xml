                <p>The collection consists of several card files created or collected by Helen
                    Worst. One card file relates to the Edmunds family of Cape May, New Jersey, and
                    Philadelphia. The cards list names and ancestries and often include related
                    articles on the people. There is a card file pertaining to information from
                    Memorials of the Huguenots in America by Rev. A. Stapleton. There are also
                    miscellaneous cards listing notes on a variety of people, as well as cards
                    grouped by people's ethnicity (French, Jewish) or arrival in America
                    (Mayflower). Many of these draw from published resources and collections
                    available at The Historical Society of Pennsylvania and some have clippings
                    attached. The collection also include several letters to Helen Worst from the
                    Welcome Society, for which Worst worked as a genealogist.</p>
