                <p>The collection consists primarily of genealogical research materials on the
                    Edmunds, Paxton, Stone, Hough and related families. Materials include:
                    correspondence; family charts; photocopies of newspaper clippings (mostly
                    marriage announcements and obituaries); clippings from various newspapers
                    including the Glassboro Enterprise (1921-1922, 1927), Boston Transcript (1946 -
                    related to genealogical research) and various Philadelphia newspapers (late
                    1800s and early 1900s); family histories; photostats of photographs; notes
                    (often related to marriages); card files on various family members (very similar
                    to the Edmunds cards in the Worst collection); and printed wedding and birth
                    announcements from the early 20th century to 1966. There is also a bound Edmunds
                    family genealogy (note in volume indicates it is an earlier version of an item
                    in the GSP collection).</p>
