            <bioghist>
                <p>Founded in 1840 by seventeen prominent Philadelphians, and led by Eli Kirk Price,
                    Woodlands Cemetery is the final resting place for numerous local and national
                    figures. The aim of the founding members was to create a peaceful sanctuary by
                    "removing the dead from the midst of the dense population of our cities, and
                    placing them in operation with beautiful works of nature; thus making them the
                    means of preserving open spaces and some of the finest park scenery near our
                    town which otherwise would be prostrated in the progress of building
                    improvements." Some of the notables buried here include Thomas Eakins, Sydney
                    George Fisher, Rembrandt Peale, Eli Kirk Price and Eli Kirk Price II. </p>
