            <bioghist>
                <p>Helen Morris Beitler (1915-2002) was a collector of books and 19th and early 20th
                    century ephemera. Her areas of interest included the trades and tools,
                    children's literature, boating, advertising, and Philadelphia and Pennsylvania
                    history. </p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of ephemera collected by Helen Beitler and papers relating
                    to her family. Family papers include materials related to the Cuyler, Morris,
                    Wistar, Remington, Pim, and Beekman families. These records include:
                    correspondence, much of it between Beitler's parents; photographs; home movies;
                    and estate papers. This collection is complemented by a large number of books in
                    which Ms. Beitler flagged and annotated passages relating to her ancestors.
                    Ephemera in the collection includes broadsides, postcards, billheads and
                    envelopes, programs, advertisements, calendars, almanacs, photographs and
                    cabinet cards, sheet music, and newspapers. Topics include horses and dogs,
                    boats, the print and paint industries, and Philadelphia history. Much of the
                    ephemera is from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century. There is also
                    manuscript material (in particular, several nineteenth-century ledgers) and
                    books relating to Pennsylvania but not directly related to Ms. Beitler's family.
