            <scopecontent>
                <p>Unlike the other records compiled by the Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania,
                    most of the material in this collection is original. Folders are arranged by
                    family or individual and contain a variety of material. Included are deeds wills
                    and other legal documents, correspondence, account books, bills and receipts,
                    school transcripts, photographs and printed material. Some contain volumes of
                    published family histories. Perhaps more valuable than the genealogical data
                    that can be extracted from these documents is the coverage of contemporary
                    events also highlighted through words and pictures, including the Civil War and
                    the Korean conflict. Some individuals are represented through more extensive
                    documentation, comprising a mini-collection of its own. One such instance is the
                    collection of Edwin S. Dunkerley, a former HSP volunteer. In addition to
                    material documenting his life, there are letters from an apparent relative who
                    served as a missionary in China during World War I. There is also one box of
                    mid-19th century sheet music, identified as "Miss Leach" that includes titles
                    such as "Lieutenant General Grant's Grand March," and F.B. Helmsmuller's
                    "Ruck-Ruck-Gallop," or "Hitch-Hitch." Some records are by institution such
                    as the Moyamensing Lodge No. 330.</p>
