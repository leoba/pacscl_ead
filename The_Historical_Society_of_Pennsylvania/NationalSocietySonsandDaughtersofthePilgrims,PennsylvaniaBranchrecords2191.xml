            <bioghist>
                <p>The National Society Sons and Daughters of the Pilgrims was founded in 1908 to
                    preserve the genealogies and histories of the Pilgrims, which the society
                    defines as "any immigrant who settled before 1700 within the territory which
                    began the forty-eight contiguous states of the United States of America without
                    regard to religion or place of origin." Members of the society must prove
                    lineal descent from a Pilgrim. The Pennsylvania Branch was founded in 19?? and
                    disbanded in 19??. A note on the national organization's website in 2007
                    indicated that the Pennsylvania chapter was in the process of reorganizing.</p>
