                <p>This collection chronicles several decades of displays and promotions at John
                    Wanamaker's department store, much of it under the supervision of Frederick
                    Yost. Yost began working at Wanamaker's in 1948. From 1952 to 1965 he was in
                    charge of sales promotions, and in 1965 became the Corporate Vice President.
                    Yost's background included theater and lighting design. The collection includes
                    papers and scrapbooks documenting public relations, advertising, special events,
                    and store design and display. Also included are internal office memos,
                    photographs of displays and their construction, architectural drawings, news
                    clippings, and many materials pertaining to the elaborate Christmas displays and
                    light shows that were a tradition at Wanamaker's.</p>
