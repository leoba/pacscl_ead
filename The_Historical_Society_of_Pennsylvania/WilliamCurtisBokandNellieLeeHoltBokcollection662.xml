            <bioghist>
                <p>William Curtis Bok (1897-1962), the son of Edward William Bok, was a lawyer and
                    judge in Philadelphia. He served in the Orphan's Court and the Court of Common
                    Pleas before he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Nellie Lee
                    Holt Bok (1901-1984) was religious education director at Missouri's Stephens
                    College for Women before her marriage to Curtis Bok. After their marriage in
                    1934, she became involved in politics, briefly broadcasting a radio program in
                    support of Franklin Roosevelt's. She continued to write on the topic of
                    religion, and was involved in local philanthropic activities.</p>

                <p>The focus of this collection is the personal and professional papers of Curtis
                    and Nellie Lee Bok. In addition, there is some documentation of their children
                    (Derek, Enid, and Benjamin) and their Bok and Holt ancestors (including the
                    Seymour, Easton, and Gianinni families). There are letters, travel journals,
                    photographs, and printed materials relating to the illustrious careers of both
                    Curtis and Nellie Lee. Notable correspondents include Franklin Roosevelt, Rachel
                    Carson, and Princess Grace of Monaco. The collection includes manuscripts of
                    writings by the couple, including an account of the coronation of George VI by
                    Curtis Bok, and newspaper and magazine articles by Nellie Lee Bok. The
                    collection also includes school records, diplomas, certificates, social diaries
                    and calendars, and posters.</p>
