            <bioghist>
                <p>Jack Akerboom is a genealogist who has published several works, including The
                    Descendants of Hans Lauer/Lower. </p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of family histories, church and cemetery records,
                    marriage records, and county genealogical records. Family histories are largely
                    compiled by other genealogists, some of them being previously published works
                    and some of them unpublished research. One exception is the Cotterman family
                    history, which was compiled by Harold Van Horn and Jack Akerboom. The church and
                    cemetery records consist of photocopies of various indexes and lists which
                    Akerboom has pulled together and arranged. Three of the cemetery records were
                    published by the Tulpehocken Settlement Historical Society. The two-volume
                    Genealogical and Biographical Annals of Northumberland County was downloaded
                    from rootsweb.org.</p>
