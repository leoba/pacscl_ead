            <bioghist>
                <p>The Needlework Guild of America was founded in Philadelphia in 1885. The Guild's
                    mission was to make and distribute new garments for the needy. Members were
                    required to produce at least two garments a year to maintain active membership
                    in the Guild. As it grew, many branches were added, but the Philadelphia branch
                    retained its identity as the "parent branch." </p>
