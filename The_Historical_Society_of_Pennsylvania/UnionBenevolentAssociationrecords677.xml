            <bioghist>
                <p>The Union Benevolent Association was founded in 1831 in order to assist the
                    suffering poor of Philadelphia during an unusually harsh winter. The Association
                    soon began offering social services, including counseling and material aid, to
                    families all around the city, regardless of race, religion, or nationality.
                    Assistance was provided in the form of money, food, clothing, and medicine. The
                    Association also helped many people find employment and encouraged parents to
                    send their children to school. In 1958 the Association changed it's method of
                    administering aid and began giving to other nonprofit organizations.</p>
