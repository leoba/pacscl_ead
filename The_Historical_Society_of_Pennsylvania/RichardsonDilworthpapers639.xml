            <bioghist>
                <p>Richardson Dilworth (1898-1974), was an American Democratic Party politician,
                    born in the Pittsburgh area, who served as the 116th Mayor of Philadelphia,
                    Pennsylvania from January 2, 1956 until his resignation in 1962 to run for
                    Governor, a race in which he was defeated by William Scranton. Along with Joseph
                    S. Clark and others, he was at the forefront of a post-World War II reform
                    movement in Philadelphia which led to the adoption of a modern city charter that
                    consolidated city and county offices and introduced civil service examinations
                    on a broad scale to replace much of the existing patronage structure. During
                    their tenures as mayor, Clark and Dilworth introduced a variety of reforms and
                    innovations, including extensive high-rise public housing which, a generation
                    later, was condemned by many as a breeding ground for poverty and crime.
                    However, they also greatly strengthened the city planning function of
                    Philadelphia city government. Both retained Edmund Bacon as Executive Director
                    of the Philadelphia City Planning Commission, and this era is recognized as a
                    high water mark for planning, the era when Center City Philadelphia's future as
                    a commercial and residential center was rescued from decline. Dilworth's
                    Administration made a priority of saving the city's historic and irreplaceable
                    Society Hill district. Following his tenure as Mayor, he served as Partner in
                    the Philadelphia-based law firm of Dilworth Paxson LLP, which bears his name. He
                    also served as president of the Philadelphia school board, and in 1971 was
                    appointed one of two bankruptcy trustees (along with Andrew L. Lewis, Jr.) for
                    the Reading Company, the railroad company headquartered in Philadelphia.</p>
