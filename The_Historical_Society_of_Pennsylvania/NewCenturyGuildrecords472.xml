            <bioghist>
                <p>The New Century Club, the first women's club in Philadelphia, established The New
                    Century Guild in 1882 to aid "women without material assistance of male
                    support." They provided evening classes for working women in dressmaking,
                    millinery, cooking, and secretarial training. By the 1920s, it was also serving
                    as a center for business and professional women to gather and included a
                    library. Starting at Girard St., the Guild moved to 1227 Arch St. in 1893, and
                    finally settled at 1307 Locust St. in 1906.</p>
