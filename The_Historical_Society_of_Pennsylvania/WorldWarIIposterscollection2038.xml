                <p>This extensive graphic collection consists of posters produced prior to and
                    during World War II. Most are printed by the U.S. Government, and the
                    propagandistic message of the posters is strong, promoting patriotism and
                    civilian support of the country's involvement in the war. Based on the printing
                    date, some recruitment posters were published before the United States entered
                    the war. One example is the 1940 poster encouraging enlistment in the Navy in
                    order to "join our expanded fleet." While some posters urge recruitment into
                    the various military branches, others commemorate specific battles or recount
                    individual experiences. Other posters are directed toward the civilian worker,
                    rallying them to do their part and reminding them of the sacrifices servicemen
                    are making on their behalf. Gender issues are also evident, particularly in the
                    WAVES recruitment posters, inviting women to do man-size jobs. Some posters were
                    put out by business concerns. Most of these posters were also patriotic
                    declarations, with the company noted at the bottom. Others, however, tied-in
                    patriotism with their business, such as the Aldine Theatre in Philadelphia,
                    which promoted a war-related movie and American Express Travelers Cheques
                    selling war bonds and stamps. There is also a series of posters of the
                    Pennsylvania Railroad, promoting its vital role in the war effort by
                    transporting men, supplies and ammunition, and discouraging civilian use of the
                    trains during weekends and holidays since that was when servicemen were
                    traveling. Some of the artists were prominent painters and illustrators of the
                    time including Ben Shahn and David Stone Martin. A series of smaller posters
                    offer civilians a variety of directives, including the need to eat well and stay
                    healthy, turn out lights, and to keep quiet about military movements.</p>
