            <bioghist>
                <p>The Stout Collection at the Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania has its genesis
                    in November 1990 when Reverend Edmond Stout donated substantially all of his
                    extensive personal collection of family research. He also established a trust to
                    be used to purchase, acquire, accession books and other Stout genealogical
                    materials. The early research and German ancestry work in the collection was
                    begun by RADM Herald F. Stout, U.S.N. Retired, San Diego, California.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection includes genealogical research and other information about many
                    members of the Stout family. Materials include: listing of Stout family members;
                    family charts and datasheets; correspondence; photocopies of clippings and
                    primary sources; notes and extracts from marriage records, court records, church
                    records and other sources; issues of the Stout family newsletter; bound,
                    published family histories; copies of photographs, obituaries, churches, and
                    other information related to various family members; and a small number of
                    slides. There is also information about the Stout Collection at GSP, including
                    an explanation of the numbering scheme and a handout describing the trust and
                    the collection.</p>
