                <p>This collection consists of programs to the various performances and special
                    programs staged at the Academy from 1857 to 1972. Represented here are the
                    Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pennsylvania Ballet and various opera companies.
                    Also included are programs and miscellaneous material of the Orpheus Club
                    Concerts, 1872-1945 (3 boxes) and The Cecilian, 1875-1903 (1 box). The latter
                    was a society formed for the study and public performance of choral music. In
                    addition to the programs there are also 19 volumes of scrapbooks, 1850-1881
                    (with gaps), that consist of ephemera and newsclippings of reviews and
                    announcements of performances as well as special events and programs, including
                    speaking engagements by prominent people such as Edward Everett and Henry Ward
                    Beecher. The earliest volume includes a pamphlet by the American Sunday-School
                    Union in which it concludes that, "the opera is no place for a professor of
                    religion."</p>
