            <bioghist>
                <p>According to a financial report in the collection, the Soabar Company was formed
                    in 1912 as H. G. Davis Manufacturing Co. The company was formed for the purpose
                    of "manufacturing, selling, and leasing machinery, tags, tickets, and labels."
                    The company was originally located on Frankford Avenue. Subsequent locations
                    were also in the Frankford area. In 1920 the stockholders changed the name to
                    Soabar Co. This name is apparently based upon the invention of the sew-ticketing
                    machine. The company did a great deal of business with clothing retailers,
                    including Strawbridge &amp; Clothier , John Wanamaker, Gimbels, and Montgomery
                    Ward &amp; Co.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection includes records for the Soabar Company and several subsidiary
                    companies that eventually merged into Soabar, namely: Joseph J. Stone &amp; Co.

                    Corporation (1950s), and Robinson Tag &amp; Label Co. (1953-1962). There are
                    also records for the Soabar GmbH (1960s-1976), a German subsidiary. The
                    collection includes minutes of executive committees and boards of directors,
                    charters and bylaws,financial records, patents, documentation of the Company's
                    1968 merger with Avery, and records on product liability litigation. There is
                    also extensive photographic documentation of staff members, board of directors
                    members, products, company events, and factory buildings, as well as promotional
