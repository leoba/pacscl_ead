                    Pennsylvania.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection includes genealogical research materials and family histories for
                    the Barclay, Beale and related families. Nine bound family histories describe
                    different lines of the Barclay family and include family charts/pedigrees, as
                    well as photocopies of correspondence, photographs, published materials,
                    original records and maps. The collection includes additional genealogical
                    research on various family members such as correspondence, family charts,
                    photocopies from published and primary sources, and notes and notebooks. There
                    are some original land records (deeds and other papers), many concerning the
                    Rupert Griscom Beale House, 317 South 15th Street in Philadelphia. There are
                    photographs of some properties (one of the properties was once occupied by Betsy
                    Ross). The collection also includes transcription of portions of the diary of
                    Joseph Boggs Beale (original is in HSP), printed materials and application
                    materials from the Welcome Society, and rolled maps, including one showing
                    landowners in Middletown, Pennsylvania in 1798 (20th century issue; most are
                    photocopies).</p>
