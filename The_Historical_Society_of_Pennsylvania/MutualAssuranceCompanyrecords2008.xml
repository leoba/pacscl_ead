            <bioghist>
                <p>The Mutual Assurance Company for Insuring Houses from Loss by Fire, familiarly
                    known as Green Tree, was organized in Philadelphia in 1784, in order to make
                    fire insurance available to those citizens wishing to have trees in front of
                    their homes. The company was founded in response to a change in by-laws of the
                    city's first insurance company, the Philadelphia Contributionship. In 1781, The
                    Contributionship excluded houses with trees nearby from coverage. The Green
                    Tree's most important contribution to American insurance underwriting was the
                    introduction in 1801 of the perpetual policy. Prior to that time, policies were
                    written for a seven-year term, renewable without additional depost. The company
                    began this policy not only to save on administrative costs but also to avoided
                    paying the stamp tax levied in 1799 during the turmoil of the quasi-war with
                    France. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company purchased other
                    underwriters, which extended their range of coverage, including flood, ocean and
                    inland marine, private passenger and commercial automobile insurances. In 1996,
                    The Mutual Assurance Company and its various subsidiaries merged into National
                    Grange Mutual Insurance Company, headquartered in Keene, New Hampshire.</p>

                <p>The collection consists of papers arranged in five major sections: 1) histories
                    of the company, research notes, and 18th century general papers; 2) minutes of
                    meetings and related records; 3) cancelled surveys and cancelled policies; 4)
                    general papers, including correspondence; and 5) financial records and receipts.

                    18th and 19th centuries, including the 1784 article in The Independent
                    Gazetteer, announcing the meeting of several prominent men of the city that led
                    to the company's founding. Volumes include treasurer's accounts, cash books,
                    ledgers, and street registers as well as original and typescript copies of the
