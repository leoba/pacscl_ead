                    (Ray Stannard Baker), Frederick Fraley and Conrad Baker Sr., the Pepper family,
                    the Foulke family, the Ryan and Shoemaker families, the Parker family, the
                    Bond-Hall relationship, and various Teagues, including Frances Josephine
                    Stratton and Ellen Crawford Teague. There are also confirmation certificates for
                    members of the Wagner family (see Haines collection for more) and marriage
