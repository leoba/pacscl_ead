            <bioghist>
                <p>Marcia Moss Lewis (Mrs. George C.) was a professional genealogist who verified
                    information on applicants to various patriotic societies. She lived in Bryn
                    Mawr, Pennsylvania.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection is comprised of spiral notebooks and other notes of genealogical
                    research on various families, including Eichelberger, Miller, Evans, and many
                    others. The notes are from published sources, and primary sources such as deeds
                    and wills. The information pertains primarily to 18th and 19th century people,
                    mostly from Pennsylvania, although there are other states represented. There are
                    also some notes on how to conduct genealogical research.</p>
