            <bioghist>
                <p>The firm of William F. Comly and Son, Inc. was founded in Philadelphia by Samuel
                    Comly in 1834. Its origins, however, date back several years earlier when Comly
                    first began to do business as a commission merchant in the city's old historical
                    waterfront district. It is the oldest family owned and operated auction firm in
                    the United States.</p>
