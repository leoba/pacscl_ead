            <bioghist>
                <p>Hannah Benner Roach (1907-1976) was an editor, officer, and director of the
                    Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania. She was a research associate for the
                    William Penn Papers project from 1969-1975.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection includes research materials and writings by Roach. Documentation
                    includes: resource materials and drafts of Roach's work on "The Planting of
                    Philadelphia," an article published in PMHB; various William Penn items,
                    including a talk on him from 1972, reports of the Papers of project, 1969-1974,
                    copies of William Penn papers, and notes on Penn; a typed copy of Skippack
                    Deaths; information on where tax lists are located in Philadelphia;
                    transcriptions of 18th century tax lists, mostly for Elfreth's Alley (Mulberry
                    Ward); and an annotated typescript for An Account of Elfreth's Alley and Its
                    People from the Earliest Times. This manuscript was originally copyrighted in
                    1958, and (re?)published in 1995; there is a small amount of correspondence
                    related to the latter publication.</p>
