                <p>The collection consists of four sets of seemingly unrelated card files. The first
                    set appears to pertain to military service. The cards include names, information
                    about the person, and indication of military service, including during the
                    Revolution or War of 1812. The information may have been compiled from a single
                    source. The second set may have come from someone working on a particular
                    genealogy or interested in a particular Pennsylvania region. Cards include names
                    and some additional information, as well as an indication of the source of the
                    information. The third set includes brief information on various families, many
                    from New Jersey. It also include a set of cards on Rhode Island graveyards. The
                    last set appears to be either client files of a professional genealogist or file
                    related to the compilation of a particular genealogy. Cards include a person's
                    name and address, indications of transactions with the person, family names
                    listed with numerical codes, and occasional information on the person or
                    family.</p>
