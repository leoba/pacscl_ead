                <p>This vast artificial collection consists of records originally compiled by the
                    Genealogical Society of Pennsylvania. While most of the material is arranged by
                    family name, some records by compiler and by location can also be found. These
                    records comprise a variety of materials including researcher notes and
                    correspondence, reports, newsclippings, typescripts and Photostats of original
                    documents, reprints of family crests, photographs, and printed material. There
                    are some original volumes and papers such as deeds and certificates of death.
                    Within many files arranged by family is material regarding related families of
                    different surnames. Most of the documentation is secondary research material and
                    undated. Oversized documents consist of family trees, many of which are
                    elaborately rendered.</p>
