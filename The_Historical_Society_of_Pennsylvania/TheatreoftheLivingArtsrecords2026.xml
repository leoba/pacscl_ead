            <bioghist>
                <p>The Theatre of the Living Arts (TLA) was the brainchild of two local women, Celia
                    Silverman and Jean Goldman, determined to establish a regional theatre in the
                    Philadelphia area. Their goal was to develop a multipurpose performing arts
                    center to include film, dance, and music. At the time of its purchase in 1964
                    the building that would house the TLA was a derelict movie theater at 332-36
                    South Street. Together with Anthony Checchia and Howard Berkowitz, the women
                    formed a nonprofit corporation which operated the TLA, the Philadelphia Council
                    for the Performing Arts (PCPA). The first performance season bean January 1965
                    with a three-week run of "Galileo." Some of the earliest members of the
                    resident acting company included Judd Hirsh, Sally Kirkland, Morgan Freeman,
                    Estelle Parsons and Ron Liebman.</p>
