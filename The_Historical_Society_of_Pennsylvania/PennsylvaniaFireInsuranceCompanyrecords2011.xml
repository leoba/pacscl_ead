            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated in 1825, the Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Company began its operation
                    at 134 Walnut Street, which was also the dwelling house of one of its
                    incorporators, Jonathan Smith. The company issued both perpetual and temporary
                    insurance coverage. Its first perpetual policy, dated March 7, 1825, insured a
                    brick house and card manufactory located at 86 South Front Street, Philadelphia,
                    for $2,000. Dated one month earlier, Temporary Policy No. 1 was issued to cover
                    the contents of a South Front Street auction store, which were recorded as
                    "goods usually kept in Dry Goods Stores, including Household Furniture and
                    Linen, Cotton in Bales, . . . Flour, Indigo, . . . and Earthenware." The amount
                    of the policy was $10,000.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of the surveys, numbered 1349 through 20973, made of the
                    insured buildings. The earliest, Survey No. 1349, dates from 1830 and is a
                    record of Peter Pierce's two story brick dwelling located on the "east side of
                    Fourth Street between German and Shippen Streets in the Southwark area of
                    Philadelphia. Issued in 1892, Survey No. 20973 also records a brick two story
                    private dwelling located in Center City and insured for $1,000. The information
                    noted on the surveys includes overall dimensions, materials used in
                    construction, number of rooms and windows, and other significant architectural
                    features such as balconies. Outbuildings are often included in the surveys, and
                    some surveys include floor plans. Related paperwork accompanies some of the
                    surveys, including cancellation slips, extended coverage endorsements and
                    correspondence.</p>
