                <p>Women's Way of Philadelphia was started "specifically to form a coalition of
                    organizations serving women and women's causes; to improve the quality of life
                    for women and their families; to end violence against women and children in the
                    street, in the home and on the job; to fight discrimination based on sex and
                    sexual preference or orientation, with particular concern for those persons who
                    are victims of multiple discrimination due to their race, color, religion,
                    national origin, ancestry, age, or disability; to educate women to gain and keep
                    control over their bodies and their lives; to help guarantee women full access
                    to economic, educational, social and cultural opportunities; to assist
                    organizations serving women and their families throughout the country to form,
                    raise funds, and develop programs; and to engage in fundraising and such other
                    lawful activities as will contribute to the foregoing purposes."</p>
