            <bioghist>
                <p>Formed in 1857, the Numismatic and Antiquarian Society of Philadelphia was a
                    nonprofit organization "dedicated to the encouragement and promotion of
                    numismatic science and antiquarian research." Meetings were often held in the
                    homes of members, where coins and medals were displayed and papers on a variety
                    of subjects were read.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection includes member lists, invitations, typescripts, published
                    proceedings, accession catalogs for the society's library, correspondence and
                    meeting minutes, some of which include transcripts of talks given at the
                    meetings. The correspondence in the collection is from members, vendors,
                    scholars, and members of the general public seeking expert numismatic advice.
                    The collection also includes clippings, photographs, scrapbooks, a receipt book,
                    etched printing blocks,and a glass negative. The materials cover the period from
                    the society's founding and extend to the late 1960s.</p>
