                <p>The collection consists of genealogical research and personal papers compiled by
                    Gilbert Cope and his son Joseph. The largest portion of the collection is
                    comprised of surname files from the Gilbert Cope Foundation of Genealogical and
                    Historical Research (1818-1988). These files include genealogical worksheets,
                    clippings, correspondence, family charts, printed materials, and some original
                    photographs and documents (many of them relating to the Copes). Besides the Cope
                    family itself, other families heavily represented include Baily, Brinton, Brown,
                    Darlington, du Pont, Garrett, Gilbert, Hoopes, McGrew, Price, Sellers,
                    Sharpless, and Smedley. The collection includes a number of volumes of
                    correspondence to and from Gilbert and Joseph Cope, primarily on genealogical
                    topics, with particular emphasis on Cope family history. Some printed materials
                    from Pennsylvania and British institutions and groups are included.There are
                    also some personal papers for ancestors of the Copes, including account books
                    and diaries for Joseph Cope (1740-1820) and Eliza Cope (died 1862), and
                    biographical information about Gilbert and Joseph, including transcripts of
                    Gilbertâ€™s diaries. Some miscellaneous notes, drawings, and published family
                    histories are also included.</p>
