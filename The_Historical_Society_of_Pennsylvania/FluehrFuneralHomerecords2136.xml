            <bioghist>
                <p>John F. Fluehr &amp; Sons were funeral directors in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
                    They later changed their name to Fluehr Funeral Home. They were located at 149
                    W. Susquehanna Avenue and 3260 and 3301-3305 Cottman Avenue. An associated
                    funeral home was Fluehr's Funeral Home at 5401 Rising Sun Avenue in
                    Philadelphia.</p>

                <p>The bulk of the collection consists of funeral records from 1929-1980, with
                    several years missing. The funeral records include information on the deceased
                    such as name (including maiden name for married women), birth date, death date,
                    birthplace, names of family members, the cemetery and burial plot, residence
                    prior to death, and cause of death. The records also include information on the
                    funeral and burial arrangements, such as the type of casket, preparation of the
                    body, clothing, flowers, and the associated costs for these items. Some records
                    include the text of death notices. Each book, or section of a book, corresponds
                    to a calendar year, and the records within are in alphabetical order by last
                    name. There is also one box of miscellaneous materials, including financial
                    records and receipts from the 1970s-1980s, documentation related to a property
                    purchased in Ship Bottom, New Jersey, an honorable discharge from the army for
                    Leslie A. Lynch and estate settlement papers for Harry J. Behr and Robert
                    Licsauer.</p>
