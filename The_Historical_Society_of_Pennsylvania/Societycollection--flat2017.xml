                <p>This is an artificial collection created by HSP staff, containing manuscript
                    materials from many sources. This extensive collection is arranged
                    alphabetically. Most of the papers pertain to individuals although some are
                    grouped by organization or other group category. Material consists of
                    correspondence written by the individual, legal and formal documents, such as
                    indentures and marriage and draft exemption certificates and/or printed
                    material, such as broadsides. The individuals in this collection represent a
                    broad range of fields, such as medicine, religion, diplomacy, the military, and
                    the arts. In addition to people of local and national prominence, this
                    collection also includes foreign individuals.</p>
