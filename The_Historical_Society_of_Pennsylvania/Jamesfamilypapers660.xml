            <bioghist>
                <p>The James family, originally from Wales, came to the United States in 1711.
                    Isaiah James (b. 1830s?) moved to Germantown, Pennsylvania and purchased
                    property there. Isaiah's son Charles Henry James (1870-1957) worked at First
                    National Bank, before joining his father's grocery firm, Thomas C. Fluke &amp;
                    Company. Charles Henry married Nellie J. Hussey; they had no children. Charles
                    Henry James's nephew was Charles Mason James (b. 1910). Charles Mason married
                    Mary Effie Cameron. Both of them were historians and Charles Mason was a
                    prize-winning amateur filmmaker. Their daughter was Margaret Mason James (b.
                    1944), an educator who taught English as a second language.</p>
