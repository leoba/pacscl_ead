                <p>The collection consists primarily of photographs. The subjects of family
                    photographs include Laura Hamrick Biddle, Charles Hamrick, William Hamrick,
                    Winfield Hamrick, Charles and Oliver Hamrick, Sarah Bartholomeau, and other

                    mid- to late 20th century photographs of Philadelphia scenes, like the Delaware
                    and Schuykill Rivers and the Museum of Art (many unidentified). There is also a
                    small amount of correspondence to Laura Biddle, 1888-1892.</p>
