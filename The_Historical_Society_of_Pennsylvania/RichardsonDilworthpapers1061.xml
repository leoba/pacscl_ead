            <bioghist>
                <p>Richardson Dilworth (1898-1974) was a major figure in the political reforms of
                    the 1950s, serving first as District Attorney during the Clark administration
                    from 1952-1955 and later as mayor from 1956-1962. His appointment to the Board
                    of Education in 1965 brought about much needed reform to the Philadelphia school
                    system. For the rest of his life, he remained active in civic affairs.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>Although the papers include little documentation of Dilworth's law and mayoral
                    careers they do include large amounts of material concerning his Board of
                    Education activities, civic organizations and projects, the Reading Railroad
                    Receivership, and the Pennsylvania Governor's Committee on Transportation. These
                    papers are a major contribution to the 20th century collections at HSP, and
                    complement the Joseph S. Clark and Albert M. Greenfield Papers already in the
                    Manuscript and Archives Department.</p>
