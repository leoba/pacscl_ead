            <bioghist>
                <p>Prior to 1913 the City of Philadelphia's relations with public transit companies
                    were administered through the offices of the City Surveyor and the Bureau of
                    Highways under the general supervision of Councils' Committee on Street
                    Railroads. In that year, under an Act approved on 9 May 1913, the Department of
                    City Transit was established to coordinate the control of all transit facilities
                    located within the City with especial regard to the contract of 1907 between the
                    City and the Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company formed in that year as an
                    amalgamation of the many transit companies that had existed independently until
                    that time. Dr. Harold E. Cox is professor and chair of the department of history
                    at Wilkes University, Pennsylvania. He is the former editor of Pennsylvania
                    History and has written extensively on the history of urban transportation and
                    the development of inner cities in the nineteenth century. </p>

                    reports; minutes; financial volumes; stock ledgers; annual reports; and

                    pamphlets, 1917-1929, also arranged by Stirling; and a J. G. Brill Company
                    photograph album of "Specialties". Materials in the collection related to the
                    Willow Grove Amusement Park include: journals (1897-1906) and cashbooks
                    (1896-1897 and 1904-1911); Willow Grove scrapbook, 1907; and a plan of Willow
                    Grove. There is also a small mount of correspondence related to entertainment

                    Rapid Transit Company, prisons, and the Philadelphia school district, among
                    other things. Most of these are annual reports or agreements.</p>
