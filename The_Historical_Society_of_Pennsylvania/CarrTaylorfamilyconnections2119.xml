                <p>The collection consists of eight binders of genealogical research compiled by
                    Pauline J. (Carr) Smith entitled "Carr Taylor Family Connections." The binders
                    include genealogical information about the Carr and Taylor families of Iowa and
                    numerous related families, primarily from the Midwest. These volumes resemble
                    scrapbooks with photocopies of primary sources and genealogical information
                    interspersed throughout in a largely unsystematic way. The bulk of the
                    documentation consists of family group sheets that list family members and
                    births, deaths, and marriages; there are also a number of photocopies of
                    photographs, newspaper articles, and unusual items like sheet music or
                    individual pieces of correspondence. It is not always clear how the family data
                    and other information is related and sources are often not cited. The binders
                    appear to have been compiled in the 1990s.</p>
