                <p>The collection consists of genealogical and research materials compiled by
                    Reverend Carl T. Smith. Historical and genealogical information pertains to
                    areas and people of Pennsylvania and Ohio, including Dayton, Montgomery County,
                    Jefferson Township (all Ohio), Philadelphia, and Bucks County. Information is
                    extracted from land records, cemetery records, tax records, church records,
                    register of wills, and newspapers. The collection also includes a typescript of
                    Smith's thesis, titled The History of German Lutheranism in Pennsylvania Before
                    Muhlenberg, with Especial Emphasis on John Caspar Stoever, Jr., published in
                    1943 (submitted for Bachelor of Divinity at Union Theological Seminary), and
                    research materials on Presbyterian and Reformed churches, including lists of
                    members, notes on church histories and deeds belonging to various churches
                    (mostly city and county of Philadelphia and other areas of Pennsylvania). There
                    are issues of The County Court Note-Book: A Little Bulletin of History and
                    Genealogy, 1923-1931 (published by Milnor Ljungstedt in Bethesda, Maryland) and
                    a scrapbook of genealogical clippings from an Ohio newspaper and a similar
                    notebook entitled "Our Forefathers or Miami Valley Genealogies" by Lindsay M.
