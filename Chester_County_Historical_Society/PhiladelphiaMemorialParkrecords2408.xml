            <bioghist>
                <p>Philadelphia Memorial Park in Frazer, PA became the final resting place for
                    thousands of burials exhumed from Philadelphia cemeteries. Post WWII urban
                    renewal efforts and increasing development pressures led to the disappearance of
                    some historic city cemeteries. Many of these cemeteries were organized as
                    associations that provided low cost burials to their members - primarily working
                    class residents of Philadelphia. </p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
