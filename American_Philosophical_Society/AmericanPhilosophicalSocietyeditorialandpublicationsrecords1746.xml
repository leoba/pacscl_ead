            <bioghist>
                <p>Founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, the American Philosophical Society was the
                    first learned society in the United States. The Publications Department of the
                    American Philosophical Society publishes Transactions, a highly respected series
                    of monographs, five of which are currently published each year; Memoirs, books
                    of various lengths in many scholarly disciplines; a quarterly journal, the
                    Proceedings, which includes papers read at the Society's biannual meetings,
                    independent essays sent to the American Philosophical Society by outside
                    scholars, and biographical memoirs of Society members; and an annual Yearbook,
                    which includes a listing of resident and foreign members, the President's Annual
                    Message, the Report of the Executive Officers, and the Society's charter and
                    laws. Manuscripts are reviewed by the Committee on Publications, which meets
                    three times a year.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The bulk of this material consists of correspondence related to both accepted and
                    declined submissions, including acknowledgment of receipt of manuscripts,
                    rejections and acceptances, copyright documents, and reviewer's reports. There
                    are multiple chronological groupings, but files tend to be alphabetical by
                    author or article subject within each grouping. The collection contains
                    financial documentation, including sales records from 1939 to 1972 and 1994 to
                    1996, publications inventory from 1935 to 1960, a cash book from 1955 to 1963,
                    and purchase orders/invoices, royalty payments, and publication costs. Other
                    administrative files include permissions to quote publications, topical files on
                    the Yearbook, circulars, advertising, correspondence with printers and
                    publishers (primarily invoices and quarterly statements), and minutes, agendas,
                    and ballots from the Committee on Publications. The collection also includes
                    card files for Transactions 33-61, Proceedings 114-119, and declined authors; a
                    small number of manuscripts, including a camera-ready manuscript for Public
                    Organization in Ancient Greece by Nicholas F. Jones; and editorial and general
                    correspondence files (1922-1926) from the office of Arthur W. Goodspeed,
                    Secretary.</p>
