                <p>Gertrude Houston, daughter of Henry Howard Houston and Sallie Sherrerd Bonnell,
                    married George Woodward, M.D., son of Stanley and Sarah Butler Woodward, in
                    1894. In 1911, Gertrude and George Woodward moved to Krisheim, the family estate
                    in Chestnut Hill. The couple had five children: Henry Howard Houston, George
                    Jr., Stanley, Charles, and Gertrude (Quita). Quita Woodward (1909-1934) died of
                    Hodgkin's Disease. As a child, she was close friends with her cousin, Eleanor
                    Houston Smith.</p>
