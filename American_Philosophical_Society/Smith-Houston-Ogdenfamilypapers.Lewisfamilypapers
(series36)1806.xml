            <bioghist>
                <p>The Lewis family is allied to the Smith family through the marriage of Mary Lewis
                    (1808-1892) and George Smith (1804-1882). The founder of the Lewis family in
                    America was Ralph Lewis. His son, grandson, and great-grandson were named
                    Abraham I, II, and III, respectively. Abraham Lewis I (1675-1768) married Mary
                    Morgan; and Abraham Lewis II (1714-1775) married Ann Reese in 1751. Abraham
                    Lewis III (1759-1825) married Rebecca Lawrence in 1806; and their daughter Mary,
                    married George Smith (1804-1882). Mary and George Smith were the grandparents of
                    Lawrence M.C. Smith, husband of Eleanor Houston Smith.</p>
