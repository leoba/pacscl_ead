            <bioghist>
                <p>Founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, the American Philosophical Society was the
                    first learned society in the United States. For over 250 years, the Society has
                    played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life. Until the
                    mid-nineteenth century, the Society fulfilled the role of a national academy of
                    science, national library and museum, and even patent office. Early members of
                    the Society included Thomas Jefferson, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, Stephen
                    Peter Du Ponceau, George Washington, and many other figures prominent in
                    American history. Executive Officers of the APS for the period covered by these
                    records included Edwin G. Conklin, Luther P. Eisenhart, George W. Corner,
                    Whitfield J. Bell, Jr., and Herman H. Goldstine.</p>
