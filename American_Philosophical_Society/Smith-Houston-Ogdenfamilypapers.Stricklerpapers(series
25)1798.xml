                <p>The Strickler is allied to the Houston family through the marriage of Susan
                    Strickler to Samuel Nelson Houston. Jacob Strickler, a member of the
                    Pennsylvania State Legislature between 1797 and 1800, lived in Lancaster County.
                    He married Sarah Wilson, and their daughter Susan married Samuel Nelson Houston.
                    The son of Sarah and Samuel N. Houston was Henry Howard Houston, father of
                    Eleanor Houston Smith.</p>
