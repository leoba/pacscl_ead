            <bioghist>
                <p>Founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, the American Philosophical Society was the
                    first learned society in the United States. For over 250 years, the Society has
                    played an important role in American cultural and intellectual life. Until the
                    mid-nineteenth century, the Society fulfilled the role of a national academy of
                    science, national library and museum, and even patent office. Early members of
                    the Society included Thomas Jefferson, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, Stephen
                    Peter Du Ponceau, George Washington, and many other figures prominent in
                    American history.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of financial records of the American Philosophical Society.
                    The bulk of the collection consists of "warrants" listing payees and amounts
                    for expenditures from 1938 to 1992 and supporting documents including receipts.
                    The collection also includes a check register and general ledger from the 1980s,
                    a small batch of "worthless securities" and related correspondence, tax
                    information for employees and quarterly tax returns from 1986-1987, and cash
                    books covering the period from 1932 to 1941.</p>
