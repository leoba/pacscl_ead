            <bioghist>
                <p>Founded in 1743 by Benjamin Franklin, the American Philosophical Society was the
                    first learned society in the United States. Early members of the Society
                    included Thomas Jefferson, David Rittenhouse, Benjamin Rush, Stephen Peter Du
                    Ponceau, George Washington, and many other figures prominent in American
                    history. Presently, there are over 900 members around the world, with 85% of the
                    membership residing in the United States; foreign members represent more than
                    two dozen countries. Members are organized into five classes: Mathematical and
                    Physical Sciences; Biological Sciences; Social Sciences; Humanities; and The
                    Arts, Professions, and Leaders in Public and Private Affairs. Two hundred
                    members of the Society have received the Nobel Prize.</p>
