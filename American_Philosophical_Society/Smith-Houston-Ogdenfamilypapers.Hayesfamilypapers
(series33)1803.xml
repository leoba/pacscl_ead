            <bioghist>
                <p>The Hayes family is allied to the Smith family through the marriage of Elizabeth
                    Hayes to George Smith. The founders of the Hayes family were Richard Sr. (1697)
                    and his son Richard Jr. (1738). Richard Hayes, Jr., married Elizabeth Lewis in
                    1697. Their son Benjamin (1710-1764) married Mary Jones in 1737, and they had a
                    daughter Elizabeth (1738-1767). Elizabeth Hayes married George Smith (1732-1787)
                    in 1764. George and Elizabeth Smith were the great-grandparents of Lawrence M.C.
                    Smith, husband of Eleanor Houston Smith.</p>
