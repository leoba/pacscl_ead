            <bioghist>
                <p>Ching Chun Li (1912-2003) was a population geneticist. He received his bachelor's
                    degree from the University of Nanking in 1936 and his Ph.D. from Cornell
                    University in 1940. He was a professor at the University of Nanking (1943-1946)
                    where he ran a contemporary and vigorous genetics research and training program.
                    In 1946, he was named professor and chairman of Agronomy at the National Peking
                    University (1946-1950). After the Communist Revolution in China, the genetic
                    theories of Trofim Lysenko were held by the government to be the only ones
                    compatible with dialectical materialism, and supporters of Mendel were severely
                    repressed and sometimes even in physical danger. Li refused to follow the
                    official policy and was forced to resign. He and his family fled China, arriving
                    in Hong Kong in 1950. From there, he emigrated to the United States, where he
                    was hired as a research fellow and assistant professor of biostatistics at the
                    University of Pittsburgh. He remained at Pittsburgh for the remainder of his
                    career, retiring in the early 1980s as professor emeritus. After his retirement,
                    Li continued to work and publish papers.</p>
