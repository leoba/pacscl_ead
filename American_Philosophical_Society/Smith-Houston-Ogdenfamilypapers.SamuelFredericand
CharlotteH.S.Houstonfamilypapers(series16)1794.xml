                <p>Samuel Frederic Houston (1866-1952) and Charlotte Harding Shepherd (1867-1940)
                    were married in Philadelphia in 1902. The marriage was the second for both Sam
                    and Charlotte. Sam's first marriage, in 1887, to Edith Atlee Corlies (1864-1895)
                    of Philadelphia, resulted in three children, Edith (1888-1970), Margaret
                    (1891-1970), and Henry Howard II (1895-1918). Edith died from complications
                    developed after the birth of Henry, in 1895. Henry II died while a soldier in
                    World War I. After about seven years of living at Druim Moir with his children
                    and mother, Sallie Sherrerd Bonnell Houston, Sam married Charlotte. Charlotte, a
                    widow and friend of Sam's first wife, brought two children to Druim Moir,
                    Charles Wardell Brown, Jr. (1891-1951) and Charlotte Harding Brown (1895-1973).
                    Sam and Charlotte had one child together, Eleanor, born in the summer of 1910.
                    The Houstons took a number of trips abroad, chief amongst was a 1902-1903 trip
                    to Europe. Sam, Charlotte and the children sailed the eastern Mediterranean and
                    made ports of call at Tunis, Malta, Zante, Delphi, Corinth, Athens,
                    Constantinople, Knossos, Gournia, and Venice. </p>
