            <bioghist>
                <p>Born in 1895 to Samuel Frederic and Edith Altee Corlies Houston, Henry Howard
                    Houston II (1895-1918), nicknamed "Hennie," was the last of the couple's three
                    children, and their only son. Henry graduated from the University of
                    Pennsylvania in 1916, and in June of that year enlisted in Battery "C" of the
                    1st Pennsylvania Artillery. He went with his unit to the Mexican border when
                    President Wilson called for troops to respond to Pancho Villa's raids into the
                    United States. Along with his cousin, Henry Howard Houston Woodward, Hennie
                    served in France with the American Ambulance Service (later, American Field
                    Service). When the United States entered the hostilities in Europe, Hennie
                    rejoined his fellow Pennsylvanians in the 53rd Field Artillery Brigade of the
                    American Expeditionary Force, and served as aide-de-camp for Brigadier General
                    William G. Price, Jr. Both Henry Houston II and Henry H. H. Woodward were killed
                    in France in 1918. Hennie died in the village of Arcis-le-Ponsart (Department of
                    the Marne) on 18 August, a short time after being struck by fragments from an
                    exploding artillery shell. </p>
