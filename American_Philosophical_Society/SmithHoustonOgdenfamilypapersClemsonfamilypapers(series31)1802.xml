                <p>Lawrence M. C. Smith's mother, Gertrude Gouverneur Clemson (1867-1947), provides
                    the connection between the Clemson and Smith families. The daughter of the
                    Reverend Thomas Green Clemson (1833-1888) and Sarah Frances Ogden
                    (1833-[1910?]), Gertrude married Lewis Lawrence Smith (1864-1931) in 1892.
                    Thomas Green Clemson (d.1888), an Episcopal churchman and rector of churches in
                    Waddington, NY and Radnor, PA was the son of the Reverend John B. Clemson
                    (1803-1891) and his wife, Margaretta [Jacobs?] (1809-1838). John had a brother,
                    Thomas Green Clemson (1807-1888), who was a prominent agriculturalist and is the
                    namesake of Clemson University. Gertrude Gouverneur Clemson's siblings included
                    Margaretta Helen Clemson (b.1874), and Ludlow Ogden Clemson (1870-1888).</p>
