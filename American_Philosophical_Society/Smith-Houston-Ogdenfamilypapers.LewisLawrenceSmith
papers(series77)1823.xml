                <p>Lewis Lawrence Smith (1864-1931), the son of A. Lewis and Rebecca Levis Wood
                    Smith, was a prominent Philadelphia attorney. Smith graduated from the
                    University of Pennsylvania with an A.B. degree in 1884. In 1888 he was awarded a
                    Master of Arts degree. Smith served as general counsel for the Lansdowne Bank
                    &amp; Trust Co., First National Bank of Darby, and the Drexel Hill Title &amp;
                    Trust Co. He also held memberships in the University Club, Historical Society of
                    Pennsylvania, Delaware County Historical Society, Delaware County Institute of
                    Science, and the State Bar Association. In 1892 Smith married Gertrude
                    Gouverneur Clemson (1867-1947), the daughter of the Rev. Thomas Green Clemson
                    (1833-1888) and Sarah Frances Ogden (1833-1910?). The couple had three sons:
                    Lewis Gouverneur (1893-1919), Ludlow Ogden (b. 1899), and Lawrence Meredith
                    Clemson (1902-1975). </p>
