            <bioghist>
                <p>The Levis family is allied to the Smith family through the marriage of Rebecca
                    Levis Wood and Abraham Lewis Smith. Samuel Levis (1649-1734), the founder of the
                    Pennsylvania family, settled in the state in 1682 and built the family home.
                    About four generations later (?), Margaret Garrett Levis, one of Samuel Levis's
                    descendants, married Joseph Wood. Their daughter, Rebecca Levis Wood
                    (1837-1925), married Abraham Lewis Smith (1831-1914) on 28 April 1859. Abraham
                    and Rebecca Smith's four children were Henry Clement, Rebecca Emily, Lewis
                    Lawrence, and Helen Bright. Lewis Lawrence Smith was the father of Lawrence M.C.
                    Smith, the husband of Eleanor Houston Smith.</p>
