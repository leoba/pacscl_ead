                <p>The Ludlow family is allied to the Smith family through the marriage of Gertrude
                    Gouverneur Clemson to Lewis Lawrence Smith. Gabriel Ludlow (1663-1736) emigrated
                    from England to New York in 1694. Three years after his arrival, he married
                    Sarah Hanmer. Thomas Ludlow, their son, married Catharine Leroux; their daughter
                    was Sarah Frances (1744-1823). Abraham Ogden (1743-1798) married Sarah Frances
                    Ludlow (1744-1823). Their son, Issac (1784-1867) married Sarah Ogden Meredith
                    (1803-1878) in 1828. Issac and Sarah Ludlow's daughter, Sarah Frances Ogden
                    (1833-[1910]), married Rev. Thomas Green Clemson (1833-1888). Their daughter,
                    Gertrude Gouverneur Clemson (1867-1947) married Lewis Lawrence Smith (1864-1931)
                    in 1892. Their son, Lawrence M.C. Smith, was the husband of Eleanor Houston
                    Smith.</p>

                <p>The Ludlow family papers contain a reprint from the New York Genealogical and
                    Biographical Record entitled "Gabriel Ludlow and His Descendants," which gives
                    extensive genealogical and historical information about the family in the
                    eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The series also contains clippings about
                    and an engraving of Ludlow Castle (1813), i.e., Stokesay Castle in South
                    Shropshire, England, which was the family residence for ten generations.</p>
