            <bioghist>
                <p>Sarah Tyson Rorer (1849-1937) was a pioneer of dietetics and the most famous
                    cooking teacher of her time. In 1882, she founded the Philadelphia Cooking
                    School, where she offered cooking classes, a chemistry class, and classes on
                    preparing proper meals for both the sick and healthy. She wrote popular magazine
                    columns for Ladies Home Journal and for Table Talk, a Philadelphia-based
                    monthly. She published her first cookbook, Mrs. Rorer's Philadelphia Cook Book,
                    in 1886. Rorer closed her cooking school in 1903, and published her last
                    cookbook in 1917. Later in her life, she became interested in politics, serving
                    as president of the Lebanon County League of Democratic Women, and touring
                    Pennsylvania at the age of 79 in support of Presidential candidate Al Smith.
                    During the Great Depression of the 1930s, she lost her investments and her book
                    royalties, and was destitute. She had to rely on the good will and generosity of
                    former students and professional groups, who organized a pension fund for
                    her.</p>
