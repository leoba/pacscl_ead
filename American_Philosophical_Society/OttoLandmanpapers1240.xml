            <bioghist>
                <p>Otto Landman was born in Germany in 1925. He and his family fled the Nazis when
                    he was 15, emigrating to the United States. He received his master's degree in
                    chemistry and his doctorate in microbiology from Yale University and did
                    postdoctoral work in microbial genetics at the California Institute of
                    Technology and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Beginning in
                    1956, he was the civilian chief of microbial genetics at the Army's labs at Fort
                    Detrick. He was a professor of microbial genetics at Georgetown University from
                    1963 to 1986. In his retirement, he published articles showcasing his research
                    into experimental evidence supporting the long-discredited theory of the
                    inheritance of acquired characteristics. He died in 2003.</p>
