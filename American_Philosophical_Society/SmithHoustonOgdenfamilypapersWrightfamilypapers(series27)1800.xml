            <bioghist>
                <p>The Wright family is allied to the Houston family through the marriage of Susanna
                    Wright and Dr. John Houston. Susanna Wright was the daughter of John Wright, a
                    prominent local figure who owned the only ferry at an important crossing of the
                    Susquehanna River between Columbia and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. She married
                    Dr. John Houston, and they raised nine children. Their youngest child, Samuel
                    Nelson Houston, was the father of Henry Howard Houston.</p>
