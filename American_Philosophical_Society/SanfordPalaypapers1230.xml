            <bioghist>
                <p>A pioneering neuroscientist, Sanford L. Palay (1918-2002) began research into the
                    structure and function of the brain as a student at Western Reserve Medical
                    School, where he received his MD in 1943. His research on the fine structure of
                    synaptic vesicles at the Rockefeller Institute in 1953 resulted in a series of
                    electron micrographs that are often cited as the first images of the synapse and
                    of the structures that release messenger chemicals in the brain. His later work
                    at the National Institutes of Health and at Harvard Medical School (1961-1989)
                    helped provide a well-rounded picture of the structure of neuroglia (cells that
                    support and protect neurons) and of the cerebellum. In 1980, Palay become the
                    Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Comparative Neurology, a position he held for
                    fourteen years. After his retirement from Harvard, Palay accepted a position as
                    Distinguished Scholar-in-Residence in the Department of Biology at Boston
                    College.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The Palay collection contains the bulk of Palay's professional correspondence
                    from his days as a medical student until after his retirement. The collection
                    also contains some personal correspondence. Other materials include: Palay's
                    course notes, papers, and laboratory notes from his undergraduate and graduate
                    work; college yearbooks; diaries and calendars; drafts and proofs of papers and
                    books, including Cerebellar Cortex, The Fine Structure of the Nervous System,
                    and Coexistence of Neuroactive Substances in Neurons; a three-volume collection
                    of Palay's articles; research notes on brain anatomy and physiology and on the
                    golgi apparatus; lecture notes, examination questions, and handouts from courses
                    Palay taught at Harvard and Yale; audio and video recordings of some of Palay's
                    lectures; student records, including grade sheets; correspondence and
                    recommendation letters for postdoctoral fellows; and a large number of electron
                    micrographs of brain structures. The collection also includes editorial files
                    from Palay's tenure as the editor of the Journal of Comparative Neurology
                    (1980-1997). These files consist of correspondence with authors, reviewers, and
                    publishers; reviewer and editorial comments; and reprints and offprints of
                    articles from other publications.</p>
