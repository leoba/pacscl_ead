            <bioghist>
                <p>James Renwick (1792-1863) was an English-American scientist and engineer. Renwick
                    graduated from Columbia College in 1807. In 1820 he was appointed professor of
                    chemistry and physics in that college, a position he held until 1854. In 1838 he
                    was appointed by the U.S. government one of the commissioners to explore the
                    line of the boundary, then settled by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, between
                    Maine and New Brunswick. In addition to his collegiate duties he wrote the
                    biographies of Robert Fulton, David Rittenhouse, and Count Rumford, in Sparks's
                    American Biography; a Memoir of DeWitt Clinton (1834); and a Treatise on the
                    Steam-engine (1840-1841). His textbooks, Outlines of Natural Philosophy (1832),
                    and Outlines of Geology (1838), were the first works of their kind published in
                    the United States, and, with his other educational works, have passed through
                    numerous editions. Renwick died in 1863. His son, James Renwick, Jr.
                    (1818-1895), was a successful 19th century architect.</p>
