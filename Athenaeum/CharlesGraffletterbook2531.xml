            <bioghist>
                <p>Charles Graff (b. 1779) was a Philadelphia merchant. He worked for the firm of
                    Dutilh and Wachsmuth from 1795 to 1803, and later for Louis Clapier. He may also
                    have worked for Pleasants and Graff. His brother was Frederick Graff
                    (1774-1847), of Fairmount Waterworks fame. Graff was also a business agent for
                    Adam Seybert. Graff's son Charles Jr. accompanied Adam and his son Henry to
                    attend school in Paris. The older Graff continued to act as the family's
                    representative after Adam Seybert's death in 1825. Graff's other son was
                    Frederick. Graff was President pro-tem of the Union Canal Co. (until 1841) and
                    served as a director of the Philadelphia Bank (also until 1841).</p>

                <p>This is a letterbook of Charles Graff. The letters discuss business matters; some
                    letters also describe the economic situation of Philadelphia and various
                    political, cultural, and social events. A number of the letters are addressed to
                    Henry Seybert in Paris, on whose behalf Graff conducted some business. There are
                    also letters to Graff's son Frederick and letters related to personal matters,
                    such as restoration of artworks and orders for wine. The volume also includes a
                    brief account of Graff's travels to Batavia, Jamaica, Macao and Canton, and a
                    longer account of his travels to Europe in 1833; and an inventory of his
                    collection of books on fine arts. Several letters, dated 1847, are from Graff's
                    son Charles and are related to his late father's estate. </p>
