            <bioghist>
                <p>William Meredith (1772-1844) was a Philadelphia attorney and president of the
                    Schuylkill Bank. He was the third son of Jonathan Meredith, a tanner who
                    immigrated to the United States from England in the 1750s. In 1795, William
                    Meredith married Gertrude Gouverneur Ogden, a respected writer. The couple's
                    eldest son was William Morris Meredith (1799-1873), who followed his father into
                    the legal profession but made his most significant contributions as a
                    Pennsylvania state representative (1824-1828), as the secretary of the treasury
                    in the cabinet of Zachary Taylor (1849-1850), and as the Pennsylvania attorney
                    general (1861-1867).</p>
