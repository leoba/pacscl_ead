            <bioghist>
                <p>Andrew Cock (Cox) was a farmer and land owner who lived in Kingsess, in the
                    County of Philadelphia in the 18th century. He was the son of Valentine Cock and
                    brother of Otter Cox. Newesingh, or Navisink, was a piece of marshland near the
                    Schuylkill River. The land was granted in 1669 by the Dutch governor, Peter
                    Stuyvesant of New York to Peter Cock, and confirmed to him in 1681 by Governor
                    Francis Lovelace (1621-1675) of New York, and reconfirmed by William Penn after
                    his arrival.</p>
