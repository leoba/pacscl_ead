            <bioghist>
                <p>The Presbyterian Center for Mission Studies was an organization that supported
                    the Worldwide Ministries Division of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and
                    cooperated with other affinity groups in the work of mission in the world. The
                    Center, which operated out of Pasadena, California, was founded in the mid 1970s
                    and was dissolved in 2005. After its dissolution, the Center's resources were
                    folded into the Presbyterian Frontier Fellowship, in Richfield, Minnesota.</p>
