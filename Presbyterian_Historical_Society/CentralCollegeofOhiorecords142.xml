            <bioghist>
                <p>The Central College of Ohio was organized by the Presbytery of Marion, Ohio, in
                    March 1842. Squire Timothy Lee gave 100 acres of land and an endowment, and
                    provided for the initial facilities, which included four buildings. The school
                    continued to operate until 1893, when it was forced to close due to lack of
                    financial support.</p>
