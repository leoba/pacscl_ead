            <bioghist>
                <p>The Kingsboro Academy was formed by members of the Presbyterian Church in
                    Gloversville, New York. A plot of land was provided by David Potter in 1831, and
                    money was raisied for the construction of a building. The school opened in 1832.
                    Mr. Waldo was the Academy's first principal. In 1837, Horace Sprague became
                    principal, and Mrs. Sprague was his assistant and also taught at the Academy.
                    The school was incorporated by the Regents of the University of the State of New
                    York in 1839.</p>
