            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Home Missionary Society was a multi-denominational organization
                    founded in 1841 to provide financial support to congregations around the
                    Philadelphia area and to spread the gospel to the destitute. The Philadelphia
                    Home Missionary Society was an auxiliary to the American Home Missionary
                    Society.</p>
