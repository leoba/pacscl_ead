            <bioghist>
                <p>The Presbyterian Ministers' Association of New York was organized in 1869 for the
                    purpose of mutual fellowship. The members met regularly to hear papers read and
                    to hold discussions on a variety of topics. Members of the Association were
                    ministers of Presbyterian, Reformed, and Congregational churches in New York
                    City and vicinity.</p>
