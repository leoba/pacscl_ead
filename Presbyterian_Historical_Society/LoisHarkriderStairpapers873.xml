            <bioghist>
                <p>Lois Harkrider (1923-1981) was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin. She earned her BA at
                    Smith College in 1944. She married Ralph Martin Stair of Waukesha; they had two
                    sons. In 1957 Stair was ordained a ruling elder of the First Presbyterian Church
                    of Waukesha. She was a commissioner to the 171st General Assembly (UPCUSA)
                    (1959) and was elected secretary to the Standing Committee on Theological
                    Education. She became Vice-Moderator of Milwaukee Presbytery in 1965 and was
                    subsequently the first person to serve two successive terms as moderator of that
                    presbytery. In 1968 she was named vice-moderator of Wisconsin Synod and
                    moderator the year after that. In 1971 Stair became the first woman to be
                    elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the United Presbyterian Church in
                    the U.S.A., in the face of a storm of controversy which had begun only days
                    before. An agency of the Church had set up a $10,000 fund to support the defense
                    of African-American militant Angela Yvonne Davis, who was charged with
                    conspiracy and murder. Over 7,000 church members from across the country
                    protested the fund, but Moderator Stair held firm in defense of it, stating that
                    "Angela Davis may be the symbol of the Black's fight for justice." Stair
                    maintained her involvement with the Presbyterian Church after her term as
                    moderator ended, working with the Council on Church Union until her death in
                    1981.</p>
