            <bioghist>
                <p>The Sanctuary Movement was a religious and political movement of approximately
                    500 congregations in the U.S. that helped Central American refugees by
                    sheltering them from Immigration and Naturalization Service authorities. The
                    movement flourished between 1982 and 1992. Various denominations were involved,
                    including Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Jews, Unitarian
                    Universalists, Quakers, and Mennonites.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>These materials are an artificial collection documenting the Sanctuary Movement
                    and include weekly updates of the Arizona Sanctuary Defense Fund, January to
                    April, 1986; newspaper clippings about the Movement and the "Sanctuary 11";
                    and a copy of Seeking Safe Haven: A Congregational Guide to Helping Central
                    American Refugees in the United States. The collection also includes two
                    newsletters of the American Theological Library Association, 1985. (The
                    newsletters have no apparent connection to the Sanctuary Movement.)</p>
