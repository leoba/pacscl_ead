            <bioghist>
                <p>The Afro-American Presbyterian Council of the North and West is a voluntary
                    association of ministers and laymen representing churches in the Northern and
                    Western portions of the United States. Among the Council's stated goals are
                    facilitating the more complete integration of the African American constituency
                    into the thought, program, structure, and fellowship of the Presbyterian Church,
                    U.S.A., and furtherance of responsible participation and opportunities for
                    leadership in the activities and obligations of the Church.</p>
