                <p>Presbyterians for Democracy and Religious Freedom is a caucus for reform in the
                    Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Their goal is to encourage open debate within the
                    denomination about political affairs. They believe that the church, as stated in
                    the barmen declaration, must never, "appropriate the characteristics, the task,
                    and the dignity of the state," nor "Place the word and work of the Lord in the
                    service of any arbitrarily chosen desires, purposes, and plans." PDRF's
                    objectives are educational -- to make available to members of the PC(USA)
                    "additional and alternative views" and its guiding principle is that
                    "democracy, while falling far short of our vision of the kingdom of God,
                    permits the greatest possibility of and freedom for carrying out the Christian
                    calling to proclaim as well as to live out the gospel."</p>

                    Freedom. "Central America Focus," by K. L. Billingsley is a 1988 response to a
                    report of the 199th General Assembly entitled "Central America Update." There

                    Perspectives" edited by Ted M. Dorman. The essays are a response to the
                    Advisory Council on Church and Society's booklet entitled "Presbyterians and
                    Peacemaking: Are We Now Called to Resistance?"</p>
