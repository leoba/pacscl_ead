                    (d. 1974) in 1934. Pieters did missionary service in the Philippines, and was
                    then transferred to Korea, where he preached, taught, and conducted Bible
                    institutes in rural areas. Pieters was a translator of the Old Testament and
                    other religious books into Korean and was editor of a Korean/English dictionary.
