                <p>The Presbyterian Association of Baltimore City managed property and financial
                    assets of member churches. Among the responsibilities of the Association was the
                    "Glendy Burying Ground," management of which had been turned over to the
                    Association by the Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore in 1875.</p>
