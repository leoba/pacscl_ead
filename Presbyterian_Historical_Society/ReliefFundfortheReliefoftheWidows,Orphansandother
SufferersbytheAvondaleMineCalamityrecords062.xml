                <p>The mining disaster at the Avondale Mines near Plymouth, Luzerne County,
                    Pennsylvania, occurred on September 6, 1869, resulting in the loss of nearly one
                    hundred lives. On September 9, George H. Stuart was appointed by the General
                    Committee to act as Treasurer for the collection of funds in aid of the
                    sufferers. By November 23, the relief fund had reached the sum of
                    $35,643.24.</p>
