            <bioghist>
                <p>The American Church in Paris was founded by the American and Foreign Christian
                    Union in 1857. The initial membership consisted of a small group of Americans
                    who had been meeting in a French Reformed Church since 1814. Today over 500
                    persons representing a wide variety of Christian backgrounds and traditions
                    regularly worship each Sunday.</p>
