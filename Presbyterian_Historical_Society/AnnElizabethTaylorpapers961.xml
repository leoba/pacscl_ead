            <bioghist>
                <p>Ann Elizabeth Taylor (1884-1972) was the Secretary of Missionary Support and
                    Women's Work for the Board of National Missions. Taylor graduated from
                    Macalester College in 1910 and was a trustee of the college (possibly the first
                    woman to serve in this position). She was an active member of the Madison Avenue
                    Church while she lived in New York City. When she retired she moved to Austin,
                    Texas.</p>
