            <bioghist>
                <p>The Metropolitan Christian Council of Philadelphia traces its roots back to the
                    Sunday and Adult School Union, founded in Philadelphia in 1817. The organization
                    has gone through several changes in name, scope, and mission. From 1824 to 1939,
                    the organization was known as the American Sunday School Union; from 1939 to
                    1968, the Philadelphia Council of Churches; and since 1969 as the Metropolitan
                    Christian Council of Philadelphia.</p>
