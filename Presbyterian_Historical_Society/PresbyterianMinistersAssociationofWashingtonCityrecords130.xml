            <bioghist>
                <p>The Presbyterian Ministers' Association of Washington City was a group of
                    clergymen who met regularly for mutual fellowship. At the meetings, the members
                    heard papers read and held discussions on a variety of topics. The Association
                    was formed sometime before 1895.</p>
