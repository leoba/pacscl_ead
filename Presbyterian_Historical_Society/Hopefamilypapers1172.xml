                <p>Fred (1875-1946) and Roberta (Brown) (1883-1942) Hope spent 40 years as
                    Presbyterian missionaries in Cameroon, and raised five daughters there. Fred
                    Hope's first wife, Lou Fenton Johnson Hope, also went to Cameroon to work for
                    the mission with her husband, but died after being there for a short period.
                    Edward Guthmann, the grandson of Fred and Roberta Hope, directed a documentary
                    video about the family's experiences as missionaries, entitled Return to
                    Cameroun.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of letters of Fred and Roberta Hope, written from the
                    mission field in Cameroon. The letters date from 1907 to 1919 (missing 1909 and
                    1910) and are addressed to relatives in the United States. There are some early
                    letters from Fred and Lou Hope. Many were sent from their post in Batanga
                    (Elat), Cameroon, though some were sent during furloughs in the United States or
                    in transit to Africa. The correspondence was used in Edward Guthmann's video
                    project, Return to Cameroun.</p>
