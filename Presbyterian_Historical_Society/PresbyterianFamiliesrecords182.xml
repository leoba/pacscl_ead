            <bioghist>
                <p>National Presbyterian Mariners originated in the Calvary Presbyterian Church of
                    Wilmington, California, in 1927 under the leadership of the Reverend and Mrs.
                    Louis H. Evans. The purpose was to bring couples into a closer relationship with
                    their Christian faith and the church, provide meaningful social activities, and
                    form an organized group (ship) that could be called upon to provide service
                    and/or leadership to the church in a number of ways. Originally, Mariners was
                    designed to be a couples' organization, but later opened membership to adult
                    singles as well. One of the objectives of Mariners was to "interest those
                    outside the church in uniting with the church." Individuals not formally
                    related to the church were welcome to participate in a Mariner ship. The
                    Mariners use a nautical theme for officers: Skippers (Presidents), First Mates
                    (Vice Presidents), Log Keepers (Secretaries), Pursers (Treasurers), Chaplain,
                    Cargo Masters (Work Party Chairs), and Lookouts (New Member Chairs). In 2002,
                    the group changed its name to Presbyterian Families.</p>
