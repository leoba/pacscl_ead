            <bioghist>
                <p>John Bonnell (1893-1992) was a Presbyterian minister who served for 26 years as
                    pastor of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in New York City, from 1935 to
                    1962. He was educated at Dalhousie University and Pine Hill Divinity Hall in
                    Nova Scotia. He was ordained in 1922 and served in New Brunswick and Winnipeg,
                    Manitoba, before being invited to Fifth Avenue Presbyterian in New York.
                    Beginning in 1943 Rev. Dr. Bonnell reached three million radio listeners with
                    weekly talks on the ABC network. He was also one of the first religious leaders
                    to provide inspirational messages through a "dial-a-prayer" telephone
                    number.</p>
