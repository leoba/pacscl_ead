            <bioghist>
                <p>The New York Maternal Association was formed in 1818. The main Association was
                    composed of subordinate chapters attached to individual Presbyterian churches
                    throughout the city. At monthly meetings of these chapters, mothers and their
                    children met for prayer and conversation, the purpose being to instruct children
                    in the faith. These individual chapters came together for a semiannual meeting;
                    this constituted the New York Maternal Association. At these semiannual
                    meetings, each constituent member chapter reported on their activities in the
                    previous year. Some of the group's annual reports were published in the Mother's
                    Magazine.</p>
