                <p>This is a collection of the papers of Paul Hopkins relating to his work for
                    COEMAR. Topics include inter-church relations, status of missions in Africa and
                    the Middle East and relationships between UPCUSA and local churches, and
                    overseas mission policies and the restructuring of the overseas mission program
                    of the UPCUSA, including a proposed moratorium on missions in Africa (early
                    1970s). Materials include correspondence, memoranda, minutes, reports and
                    studies, articles, clippings, itineraries, manuscript notes, typed manuscript
                    drafts of books and articles, book reviews, subject files, and some photographs.
                    Included are reports on mission activities in various countries in Africa
                    (1968-1980), in Sudan (1985-1995), and in the Middle East (1981-1984). Some of
                    the correspondence relates to the publication of Hopkins' books, articles, and
