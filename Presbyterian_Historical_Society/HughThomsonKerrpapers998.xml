            <bioghist>
                <p>Hugh T. Kerr (1871-1950) was a Presbyterian minister. He was an 1897 graduate of
                    Western Theological Seminary, and was ordained the same year. From 1897 to 1913,
                    he served as pastor in several churches in Pittsburgh, Kansas and Chicago. In
                    1913 he returned to Pittsburgh in answer to a call from Shadyside Presbyterian
                    Church, where he would remain pastor until retirement in 1946. During World War
                    I, Kerr served as chaplain to several soldiers' training camps in upstate New
                    York. Over the years, Kerr spent some of his time lecturing at various
                    seminaries, and he became a trustee of Washington and Jefferson College. He
                    served as president of the Board of Christian Education from 1923-1941 and was
                    elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the
                    U.S.A. in 1930. </p>
