                <p>The object of the Woman's Syrian Christian Temperance Union was "to promote
                    temperance throughout Syria, by encouraging 'Total Abstinence,' and discouraging
                    the sale and use of intoxicating liquors as a beverage, and promoting in all
                    possible ways Christian reform." Membership consisted of residents of Syria
                    subscribing to the object of the Society and willing to "wear the badge." Mrs.
                    H. H. Jessup was the Society's first president.</p>
