            <bioghist>
                <p>Louis Minsky founded Religious News Service in 1934 under the auspices of the
                    National Conference of Christians and Jews. From the start, Religious News
                    Service (RNS) was dedicated to providing authoritative and bias-free news about
                    religion and ethics to both the secular and religious press. In 1983, Religious
                    News Service was acquired by the Dallas-based United Methodist Reporter and
                    continued to operate as an independent news agency. In 1991, Religious News
                    Service editorial copy was distributed to the secular press by New York Times
                    Syndicated Features, Inc. In 1994, Religious News Service was purchased by
                    Newhouse News Service (NNS), and its name was changed to Religion News Service.
                    NNS is a company of Advance Publishing, a major publisher of daily newspapers,
                    as well the Conde Nast family of magazines, and Parade. Universal Press
                    Syndicate now distributes the service to daily and weekly newspapers in the
                    U.S.</p>
