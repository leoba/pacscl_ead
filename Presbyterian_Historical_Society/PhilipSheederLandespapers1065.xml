            <bioghist>
                <p>Philip Sheeder Landes (1883-1967) was born in Brazil. He studied at the American
                    School in Curitiba and then at Mackenzie College in Sao Paolo. He graduated from
                    the College of Wooster and Princeton Theological Seminary. In 1915 he returned
                    to Brazil with his wife, Margaret Bookwalter Landes (d. 1969), as a missionary
                    of the Presbyterian Church, USA. Landes made an extensive journey of missionary
                    exploration with the Rev. Franklin Graham, across the states of Baia, Goias, and
                    Mato Grosso. With his wife, he worked in Cuiaba for 15 years, establishing
                    churches in Cuiaba and several other locations. After his years in Mato Grosso,
                    he became the evangelist-at-large for the Central Brazil Mission from 1930 to
                    1935. He then served as a professor of Church History and other courses at the
                    Theological Seminary in Campinas, Brazil, until his retirement in 1954.</p>
