                <p>The Inter-Presbyterian Ministers Association of Los Angeles was established in
                    1911. The object of the Association was "the closer fellowship, the
                    intellectual stimulus, and the spiritual quickening of its members, together
                    with the promotion of that portion of the Redeemer's Kingdom with which its
                    members are especially identified." The association dissolved in 1915. </p>
