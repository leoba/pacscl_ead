            <bioghist>
                <p>The New Wilmington Mission Conference (NWMC) is a yearly meeting for youth aged
                    12 to 25 with an objective of deepening the missionary spirit and promoting
                    service and witness for Jesus Christ. NWMC grew out of the ecumenical Young
                    People's Missionary Movement. The first Conference was held in the summer of
                    1905 at Allegheny Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh. From 1906 until the
                    present, the Conference has been held on the campus of Westminster College.</p>
