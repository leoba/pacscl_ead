            <bioghist>
                <p>The Hutchinson House/Chapelwood Auxiliary was organized to support the work of a
                    nursing and rehabilitation institution in Devon, Pennsylvania, run by
                    Presbyterian Homes, Inc. In the mid-1980s, the institution was known as the
                    Eliza Cathcart Home. Around 1987, the name was changed to Cathcart Health
                    Center. In 1999, the auxiliary changed its name to Hutchinson House/Chapelwood
                    Auxiliary to reflect its work on behalf of the larger organization of which
                    Cathcart had been a part. The auxiliary held its last meeting in April 2002.</p>
