            <bioghist>
                <p>The Female Cent Society of Bridgehampton Presbyterian Church was one of many
                    Female Cent societies that were organized in the 1800s. They collected one cent
                    per week for missionary endeavors. The purpose of this organization was to
                    collect "a small sum of money which under the direction of the Presbytery of
                    Long Island shall be applied to the assistance of poor and pious youth in their
                    education for the gospel ministry."</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection is comprised of three volumes. The first volume is a record book
                    which includes minutes, 1815-1844; a list of subscribers; copies of
                    correspondence from other Cent Societies; and addresses by members. Sewn into
                    the volume is a 1985 address given at the Women's Missionary Society of the
                    Presbyterian Church of Bridgehampton, New York, and a manuscript of a sermon
                    given by Dr. Woolworth at the time of the formation of the Female Cent Society
                    of Bridgehampton. The second volume contains the constitution and treasurer's
                    account book, 1821-1836, which details the yearly accounts of the pledges of
                    subscribers of the Society. Volume three is an historical sketch of the society,
                    1815-1915, compiled by Katharine C. Wright, circa 1916.</p>
