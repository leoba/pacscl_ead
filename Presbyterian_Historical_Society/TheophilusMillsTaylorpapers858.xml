            <bioghist>
                <p>Theophilus Mills Taylor (1909-1989) was born in Cedarville, Ohio. He studied
                    architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and worked as a teacher and
                    architect in India for several years before studying theology at
                    Pittsburgh-Xenia Theological Seminary. He graduated in 1941, was ordained and
                    became assistant pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Crafton,
                    Pennsylvania. He then became pastor of the Barnet Center United Presbyterian
                    Church in Barnet, Vermont. In 1943 he became a professor of New Testament
                    literature and exegesis at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary. In 1956 he received
                    a Ph.D. at Yale University. From 1958 to 1962, Dr. Taylor served as chairman of
                    the Commission on Ecumenical Mission and Relations. In 1958, while presiding
                    officer of his church, Taylor endorsed the use of ''troops and tanks, if
                    necessary'' to enforce school integration in the South. He also criticized
                    Governor Orval E. Faubus of Arkansas for closing four high schools in Little
                    Rock rather than have them integrated. Taylor served as moderator of the General
                    Assembly from 1958 to 1959. He later took a position as secretary of the General
                    Assembly Mission Council, serving from 1962 to 1972.</p>
