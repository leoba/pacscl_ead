            <bioghist>
                <p>The Woman's Christian Temperance Union was organized in 1874 by women who were
                    concerned about the problems alcohol was causing their families and society. The
                    members chose total abstinence from all alcohol as their life style and
                    protection of the home as their watchword. Members advanced their cause by
                    entering saloons, singing, praying, and urging saloonkeepers to stop selling
                    alcohol. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union is the oldest continuing
                    non-sectarian women's organization in the United States and worldwide.</p>
