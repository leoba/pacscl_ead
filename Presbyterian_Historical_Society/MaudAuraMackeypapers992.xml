            <bioghist>
                <p>Maud Aura Mackey (1872-1957) was educated at Occidental College and Los Angeles
                    Medical College. In 1899, Mackey was appointed by the Board of Foreign Missions
                    to work in Paoting, China. She went for language training to Peking. Shortly
                    after her arrival in Peking, the Boxer Uprising took the lives of many of the
                    missionaries and Chinese church members in Paoting. When Hodge Memorial Hospital
                    was built in Paoting, she returned there and most of the remainder of her
                    service was performed there. She retired in Los Angeles in 1942.</p>
