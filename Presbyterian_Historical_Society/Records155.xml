                <p>The Philadelphia Sunday School Union, formed in 1840, was an auxiliary to the
                    American Sunday School Union (formed in 1826). The object of the Philadelphia
                    City Sunday School Union was to promote new Sunday schools in the city and
                    county of Philadelphia, to support and expand existing Sunday schools, and to
                    help schools be more efficient and effective in their work. The Union furnished
                    local schools with books and other materials. The Philadelphia Sunday School
                    Union fell into decline and ceased to meet in the early 1850s. The Philadelphia
                    City Sunday School Union was an earlier organization, formed in 1826.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of two volumes of records of the Philadelphia Sunday School
                    Union and a volume of records of the Philadelphia City Sunday School Union. The
                    first PSSU volume contains minutes of meetings of the Union from 1840 to 1852.
                    These minutes include: the Union's constitution and a copy of the constitution
                    for the Union's auxiliary branches; reports of committees; reports from
                    auxiliary branches; and election of officers and other routine business. The
                    volume also includes a list of board members, committees and their members, and
                    a list of delegates from auxiliary branches. The second PSSU volume contains
                    minutes of several sessions of the General Meeting for Discussion of the
                    Philadelphia Sunday School Union, held in 1844. Entries in the volume list
                    questions under discussion and summarize the arguments given on both sides of
                    the debate. This volume also includes minutes from meetings of various PSSU
                    committees in 1847. The Philadelphia City Sunday School Union volume contains
                    minutes of monthly and annual meetings of the PCSSU from its formation in 1826
                    to 1829. This volume includes the organization's constitution, lists of officers
                    and board members, reports of committees, and other routine business.</p>
