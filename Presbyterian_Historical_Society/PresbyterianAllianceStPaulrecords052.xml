                <p>The object of the St. Paul Presbyterian Alliance was to advance the cause of
                    Christ by promoting mutual acquaintance and Christian fellowship among the
                    members of the Presbyterian Church and congregations in the County of Ramsey and
                    the immediate vicinity, in extending the influence of that denomination, and in
                    aiding in the organization and support of new churches in the region. Alliance
                    churches included Bethlehem, Westminster, House of Hope, Goodrich Ave, Golgotha,
                    and Central, and others.</p>
