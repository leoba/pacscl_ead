                <p>This is a collection of travel scrapbooks from Mrs. Wood's extensive travels
                    around the world and in the United States. Scrapbooks include letters home to
                    family and friends, illustrated with photographs, postcards, drawings, maps, and
                    newspaper clippings. The letters consist mostly of descriptions of sights,
                    people, architecture, and modes of travel. There are a few mentions of missions
                    and occasional extracts of reports or addresses on missionary activities. The
                    collection also includes negatives from Wood's travels.</p>
