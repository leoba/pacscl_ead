            <bioghist>
                <p>Augustus Jung (d. 1952) and G. Wendell Jung (1906-1999) were both Presbyterian
                    ministers. G. Wendell Jung received his Master's in Theology from Princeton
                    Theological Seminary in 1933. He served in churches in New York and New Jersey
                    (including the Presbyterian Church at Woodbury, NJ from 1950 to 1963). From 1963
                    to 1969 he served as Field Director of Christian Education in the Synod of New
                    Jersey. In 1969 he became Interim Executive of the Synod of New Jersey. He
                    retired in 1972, but continued to serve part time as pastor in churches in
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
