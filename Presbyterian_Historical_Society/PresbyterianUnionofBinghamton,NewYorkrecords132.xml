                <p>The Presbyterian Union of Binghamton was founded in 1890. The purpose of the
                    Union was to advance the cause of Christ by the planting and nurturing of
                    Sabbath schools and churches, and by the promotion of mutual acquaintance, unity
                    of feeling, and concert of action among the Presbyterian Churches in the city of
                    Binghamton, New York.</p>
