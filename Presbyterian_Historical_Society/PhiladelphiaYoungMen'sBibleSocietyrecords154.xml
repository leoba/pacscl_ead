            <bioghist>
                <p>Philadelphia Young Men's Bible Society was established in 1837 and reorganized in
                    1840. A multi-denominational organization, its goal was the "circulation of the
                    Holy Scriptures, without note or comment" to the residents of Philadelphia and
                    the vicinity. The Committee on Forming Auxiliaries in Sabbath-schools in the
                    City of Liberties was formed in 1837 to establish auxiliaries in Philadelphia
                    churches to aid Society in its work.</p>
