            <bioghist>
                <p>The first formal meeting of the Pennsylvania Bible Society was held on December
                    12, 1808. The first president was Bishop William White and the first Vice
                    President was Dr. Benjamin Rush, signer of the Declaration of Independence. In
                    1812, the Society, now known as the Bible Society of Philadelphia published the
                    first Bible printed in the U.S. from Stereotype plates. In 1840, The Bible
                    Society of Philadelphia became the Pennsylvania Bible Society. The mission of
                    the Pennsylvania Bible Society is to "distribute Holy Scripture without note or
                    comment to all who want to hear it, at an affordable price, or free of charge to
                    those unable to pay."</p>
