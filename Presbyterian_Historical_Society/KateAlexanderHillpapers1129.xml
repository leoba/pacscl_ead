            <bioghist>
                <p>Kate Alexander Hill (1873-1960) was appointed as a career missionary under the
                    Women's Board of the United Presbyterian Church of North America in 1896. Until
                    her retirement in 1943, she served in Lyallpur, Sangla Hill, Sargodha and
                    Sialkot Districts in India (now Pakistan).</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection is comprised primarily of a photo album from Hill's missionary
                    service in Sialkot, India with the India Mission, 1896-1904. The album includes
                    photographs of staff and students of the India Mission, landscapes, and images

                    including Sialkot, Rasrur, Jhelum, and Dharmsala. The collection also includes a
                    small memo book that provides descriptions of some of the photographs in the
