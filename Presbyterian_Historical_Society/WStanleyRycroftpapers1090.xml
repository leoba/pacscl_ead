                <p>W. Stanley Rycroft (1899-1993) was born in England in 1899. He graduated from
                    Liverpool University in 1922, then went to Lima, Peru, as a missionary of the
                    Free Church of Scotland, serving as a teacher in the Colegio Anglo Peruano and
                    as vice principal from 1926 to 1940. He also taught English in the University of
                    San Marcos in Lima and in 1938 earned the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from
                    that University. In 1940 he returned to the United States and became Secretary
                    of the Committee on Cooperation in Latin America, an interdenominational
                    committee of thirty Protestant mission boards. From 1950 to 1966 he served on
                    the staff of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions and its successor, the
                    Commission on Ecumenical Mission and Relations, until his retirement. He was the
                    author of several books, including Religion and Faith in Latin America, On this
                    Foundation and The Ecumenical Witness of the United Presbyterian Church in the
                    USA. He was also a prolific writer for numerous publications. In his retirement,
                    he was active in Common Cause and held various positions of leadership at the
                    local level.</p>
