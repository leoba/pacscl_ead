            <bioghist>
                <p>Alma C. Clarke (b. 1890) was a kindergarten teacher who volunteered in 1917 to
                    work in France. Under the auspices of the Committee France America for the
                    Protection of the Children of the Frontier, she cared for war orphans in a
                    number of locales, notably the Colonie Franco-Americaine du Chateau de la Cour
                    Cheille, Indre-et-Loire. In 1918 she was recruited by the Red Cross to work as
                    an auxiliary nurse in the American Red Cross Hospital at Neuilly-sur-Seine. She
                    remained at that post until June 1919.</p>

                <p>This collection includes correspondence, scrapbooks, photographs, postcards,
                    clippings, memorabilia, and printed material collected by Clarke during her
                    service in France. Of particular note are Clarke's annotated scrapbooks of
                    wounded soldiers and war orphans. Both scrapbooks include notes and drawings by
                    Clarke's patients, photographs of patients and staff, and various
                    memorabilia.</p>
