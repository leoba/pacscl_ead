                <p>Katherine I. Woods (1886-1968) was an author, editor, and translator. She
                    reviewed books for the New York Times Book Review and was the book review editor
                    for Tomorrow. Perhaps the most notable among her translations was The Little
                    Prince, by Antoine de Saint-Exupery. </p>
