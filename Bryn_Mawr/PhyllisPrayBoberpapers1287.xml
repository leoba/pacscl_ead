            <bioghist>
                <p>Phyllis Pray Bober (1920-2002) was a scholar of Renaissance art. She graduated
                    from Wellesley College in 1941 and received her master's and doctoral degrees
                    from the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. She was a Dean of the
                    Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Bryn Mawr College from 1973 to 1980 and
                    was a professor in the History of Art and the Classical and Near Eastern
                    Archaeology departments until 1991. After her retirement she continued to write
                    and lecture. She had a lifelong interest in culinary history and much of her
                    later work focuses on this subject. </p>
