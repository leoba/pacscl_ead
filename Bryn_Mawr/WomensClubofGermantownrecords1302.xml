            <bioghist>
                <p>The Woman's Club of Germantown was founded in 1917 as an organization to
                    participate in the social, civic, educational, and philanthropic life of
                    Germantown and the surrounding community. The Club meetings were held in the
                    Johnson House, an historic building in Germantown which was once a stop on the
                    Underground Railroad . The Junior Section of the Women's Club was organized in
                    1920. Activities of the Club included: luncheons and other social events;
                    antiques, flower, and fashion shows; supporting community causes, such as a
                    local boy's chorus and the Cancer Society; various forms of war work, including
                    sewing and knitting; and cultural tours. </p>
