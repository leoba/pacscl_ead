            <bioghist>
                <p>Hermann Collitz (1855-1935) was an eminent German historical linguist and
                    Indo-Europeanist, who spent much of his career in the United States. He received
                    his doctorate in 1878 from the University of GÃ¶ttingen. In 1886, Collitz
                    emigrated to the United States, where he taught at Bryn Mawr College. In 1907,
                    he moved to Johns Hopkins University, where he took up a chair in Germanic
                    studies. In 1924, Collitz was elected the first president of the Linguistic
                    Society of America. </p>
