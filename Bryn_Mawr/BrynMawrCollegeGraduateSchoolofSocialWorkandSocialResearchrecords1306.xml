                <p>Bryn Mawr College's Graduate School of Social Work and Social Research was
                    founded in 1915 as the Graduate Department of Social Economy and Social
                    Research. Students spend a substantial portion of their time doing field work,

                    Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.).</p>
