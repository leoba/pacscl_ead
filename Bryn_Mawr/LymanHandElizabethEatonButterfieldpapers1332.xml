            <bioghist>
                <p>Lyman Henry Butterfield (1909-1982) was an historical editor. He worked as a
                    professor of English and American History at Franklin and Marshall College in
                    Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and was the director of the Institute of Early American
                    History and Culture at Williamsburg from 1951 to 1954. He is best known as the
                    editor of the papers of Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Rush, and as the editor in
                    chief of The Adams Papers. He was also a member of the board of editors of the
                    New England Quarterly from 1956 to 1982. Elizabeth Eaton Butterfield was a
                    graduate of Bryn Mawr College. She and Lyman Butterfield married in 1935. In the
                    mid-1950s, she and other Bryn Mawr alumnae in the Boston area founded the Bryn
                    Mawr Book Store in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The store grew out of a series of
                    annual book sales held to fund scholarships to area students attending Bryn
                    Mawr.</p>
