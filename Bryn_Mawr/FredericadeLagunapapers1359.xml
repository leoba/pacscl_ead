            <bioghist>
                <p>Frederica de Laguna (1906-2004) was an American ethnologist and archaeologist
                    known for her pioneering work in Northwest North America. She was the first
                    child of two distinguished philosophers, Theodore and Grace Andrus de Laguna,
                    both of whom taught at Bryn Mawr College. Her younger brother, Wallace, was a
                    geologist. She graduated from Bryn Mawr in 1927. She founded the Bryn Mawr
                    College Anthropology Department and taught anthropology at the college from 1938
                    until her retirement in 1975.</p>
