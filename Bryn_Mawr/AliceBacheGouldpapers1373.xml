            <bioghist>
                <p>Mathematician and historian Alice Bache Gould graduated from Bryn Mawr College in
                    1889, receiving her bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics. She continued
                    her study of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Newham
                    College in England from 1890-1893. In 1911 Gould traveled to Spain to do
                    research on Christopher Columbus. During World War I Gould worked as a volunteer
                    in the espionage office of the United States embassy in Spain. After the war
                    Gould returned to the United States to teach. In 1926 Gould again returned to
                    Spain to continue her research on Columbus and became involved in public
                    education measures and the establishment of local schools in Simancas. The
                    outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 forced her to return to Boston but
                    after the war she returned to Spain. She lived the remainder of her life in
                    Simancas, where she died in 1953.</p>
