            <bioghist>
                <p>Gwen Davis (b. 1936) is an American novelist and poet. She graduated from Bryn
                    Mawr College in 1954. While she has authored a number of books and articles, she
                    is perhaps most known for being sued for libel by the alleged subject of her
                    1971 novel Touching, which was about a psychoanalyst who advocated nude
                    analysis. When she and her publisher, Doubleday, were found liable for damages
                    by the court, Doubleday sued her to recover its costs, a controversial break
                    from customary practice in the publishing business.</p>
