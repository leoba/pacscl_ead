                <p>This collection consists of scrapbooks kept by Alice Gore King from the 1930s to
                    the 1970s. The scrapbooks record the lives of Millicent Carey McIntosh, a
                    Barnard dean, Katharine McBride, president of Bryn Mawr College, and many of the

                    cards. The collection also includes bound copies of a newspaper King created as
                    a child, a scrapbook of her wartime work at Pratt and Whitney Aircraft,
                    scrapbooks of reviews and fan-mail for her books on careers for women, materials
                    related to the founding and operation of the Alumnae Advisory Center, and photo
                    albums from Bryn Mawr class reunions in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
