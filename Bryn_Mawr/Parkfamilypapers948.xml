                <p>Marion Edwards Park (1875-1960) was president of Bryn Mawr College from 1922 to
                    1942. Her father, William Edwards Park (d. 1894) was a Congregationalist
                    minister in Gloversville, New York. His father was Edwards Amasa Park (1808-ca.
                    1888), a Congregationalist minister and professor of theology, philosophy, and
                    Hebrew literature at Amherst College and the Andover Seminary. E.A. Park and his
                    friend Bela Bates Edwards (1802-1852) co-founded Bibliotheca Sacra, a quarterly
                    journal of theology. B.B. Edwards was Marion Edwards Park's maternal
