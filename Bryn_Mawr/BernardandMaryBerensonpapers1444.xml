            <bioghist>
                <p>Bernard Berenson (1865-1959) was a renowned art historian and the author of
                    several books, including The Drawings of the Florentine Painters. During his
                    lifetime he was regarded as the world's leading authority on Renaissance art. He
                    worked closely with prominent collectors and a number of art dealers in
                    recommending and authenticating works for purchase. His wife, Mary (Smith)
                    Berenson (1864-1945), was also a noted art historian. They willed their estate
                    in Italy, Villa I Tatti, to Harvard University, which uses it as the home for
                    its Center for Italian Renaissance Studies.</p>
