            <bioghist>
                <p>Charlotte Mary Mew was an English poet (1869-1928). Although her life was lived
                    for the most part in poverty and despair she was still recognized by Vita
                    Sackville West as a poetess of distinction. Virginia Woolf called her the
                    greatest living poetess, and Marianne Moore, a quarter of a century after her
                    death, considered her work "above praise." Mary Davidow studied at Brown
                    University and is a professor of English at William Patterson College. Her study
                    of Mew was originally undertaken for her Ph.D., which she received in 1960. </p>
