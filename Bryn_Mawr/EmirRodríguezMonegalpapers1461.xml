            <bioghist>
                <p>Emir Rodriguez Monegal (1921-1985) was a literary critic, an editor of Latin
                    American literature, and a professor at Yale University since 1969. Especially
                    with his editorial guidance of Mundo Nuevo, he was a part of the mid 20th
                    century boom in Spanish American literature that led to many Latin American
                    writers being published outside of their home countries and gaining critical
                    recognition. He wrote key books about Jorge Luis Borges and Pablo Neruda.</p>
