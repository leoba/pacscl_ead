            <bioghist>
                <p>Faith Paulette Dreher (1945-1979) was a 1967 graduate of Bryn Mawr College. She
                    received master's of art history and philosophy degrees and a doctorate in
                    northern baroque painting from Columbia University. As a graduate student she
                    taught at Columbia University and Barnard College, and served as a consultant to
                    Harvard's Fogg Museum, the Metropolitan Museum in New York, and other
                    institutions. She was involved with the League of Women Voters in Philadelphia,
                    serving for a time as that organization's president. At the time of her death
                    from leukemia in 1979, she was a curator at the Deshong Museum of Widener
                    University. </p>
