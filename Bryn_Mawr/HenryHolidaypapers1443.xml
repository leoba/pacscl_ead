            <bioghist>
                <p>Henry Holiday (1839-1927) was an English Pre-Raphaelite painter, stained-glass
                    artist, and illustrator. His most famous painting was Dante and Beatrice. In
                    1916, Holiday met Ada Forestier-Walker, who personified for him Dante's
                    Beatrice. His illustrations were also well regarded. A set of his illustrations
                    were used for a 1981 edition of Lewis Carroll's Hunting of the Snark, published
                    by William Kaufmann in cooperation with Bryn Mawr College.</p>
