            <bioghist>
                <p>Hope Emily Allen (1883-1960), noteworthy medieval scholar, is best known for her
                    research on the 14th century English mystic Richard Rolle and for her discovery
                    of the Book of Margery Kempe. Allen received her bachelor's and master's degrees
                    from Bryn Mawr College. She later did graduate work at Radcliffe and Cambridge.
                    Allen described herself as an "independent scholar," and she never accepted an
                    academic teaching appointment. Her writing falls into three overlapping groups:
                    her early work on the Ancrene Riwle, her insight into the study of Richard
                    Rolle, and her research on the cultural background of the Book of Margery
                    Kempe.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The papers consist primarily of research notes by Allen, typescripts of medieval
                    manuscripts (some in translation), photostats of printed medieval texts, and
                    professional correspondence. Topics include the Book of Margery Kempe, Julian of
                    Norwich, the Ancrene Riwle,and Richard Rolle. The collection also includes a set
                    of scrapbooks of clippings about the discovery of the Book of Margery Kempe.</p>
