            <bioghist>
                <p>Agi Jambor (1909-1997) was an Hungarian American concert pianist and professor of
                    music. She taught at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, the Peabody Conservatory
                    of Music and was the founder of the Music School at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. She
                    came to Bryn Mawr as a visiting professor in 1957, and was appointed Professor
                    and Director of Ensemble Groups the following year. She remained at Bryn Mawr
                    until her retirement in 1977. Her first husband was Dr. Imre Patai. Patai died
                    in 1949. She was later married to the actor Claude Rains. The couple divorced in
                    1960.</p>
