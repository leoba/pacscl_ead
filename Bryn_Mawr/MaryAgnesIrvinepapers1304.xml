                <p>This collection consists of the papers of Mary Agnes Irvine. Much of the
                    collection is made up of letters to her parents written while she was serving in
                    France. There are also several letters to Irvine from acquaintances she made in
                    France. In addition there are photographs and a series of scrapbooks, from her
                    time in France and from a 1915 trip Irvine took to Canada and Alaska, that
                    contain photographs, postcards, and memorabilia. </p>
