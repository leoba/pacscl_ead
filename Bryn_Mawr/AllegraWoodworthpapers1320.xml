                <p>Allegra Woodworth (1902-1974) received her bachelor's, master's, and doctoral
                    degrees from Bryn Mawr College. She was a scholar in Tudor history and the
                    author of Purveyance in the Royal Household of Queen Elizabeth. Woodworth was
                    the Head of the History Department at The Shipley School from 1927 to 1971.</p>

                    Household of Queen Elizabeth, which was published in the Transactions of the
                    American Philosophical Society in 1945; and a work in progress on William
                    Fleetwood, Sergeant-at-law, and Recorder of London from 1571-1593. The
