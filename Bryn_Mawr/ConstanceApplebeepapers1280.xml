            <bioghist>
                <p>Constance Applebee (1873-1981) was a British athlete and educator who introduced
                    and promoted the sport of women's field hockey in the United States. Despite a
                    frail childhood, she graduated from London's British College of Physical
                    Education. Beginning in 1904 and continuing for 25 years, Applebee served as
                    director of outdoor sports at Bryn Mawr. In 1922 she helped found the United
                    States Field Hockey Association, and the following year created a field hockey
                    camp in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. For 10 years, Applebee was the editor and
                    publisher of Sportswoman, a magazine for women athletes.</p>
