            <bioghist>
                <p>Founded in 1809, the Walnut Street Theatre is the nation's oldest theater. It is
                    the official state theater of Pennsylvania, and is a national historic landmark,
                    a designation it received in 1964. It opened as The New Circus, showing
                    equestrian acts. In 1811, its name was changed to the Olympic. In 1920, it
                    became the Walnut Street Theatre. The same year, the interior of the theater was
                    rebuilt based on a design by William H. Lee. In the 1920s, the manager of the
                    theater was C.C. Wanamaker.</p>

                <p>The Walnut Street Theatre collection consists primarily of financial records for
                    the early part of the twentieth century. Materials include receipts for
                    utilities, supplies, newspaper advertisements, and printing; treasurer's
                    statements; weekly box office statements; and a small number of salary lists.
                    The collection also includes a series of letters in response to a 1923 radio
                    program, "Thumbs Down," in which the ending was left for audience members to
                    solve.</p>
