            <bioghist>
                <p>Karl W. Boer is the Distinguished Professor of Physics and Solar Energy at the
                    University of Delaware. A pioneer in the fields of solar cells, solar energy
                    systems and solid state physics, Boer arrived at the University of Delaware in
                    1962. In 1971, he established the University's Institute of Energy Conversion,
                    which was recently designated as a National Center of Excellence for
                    Photovoltaic Research and Education by the U.S. Department of Energy. Boer also
                    created SES Inc., a subsidiary of Shell Oil, and was its chairman and CEO until
                    1976 and its chief scientist until 1981.</p>
