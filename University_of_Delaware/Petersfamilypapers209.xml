            <bioghist>
                <p>Many members of the Peters family were active in public life in Pennsylvania. The
                    family owned the Belmont mansion and the adjoining Mantua Farms. William Peters
                    (1702-1789) was Secretary of the Pennsylvania Land Office. His brother, Richard
                    Peters (1704-1776), was a clergyman, Provincial Secretary, and a councilor.
                    Richard Peters (1744-1828) was the son of William Peters, and was a judge and a
                    farmer. Richard Peters (1779-1848), son of Judge Richard Peters, was the fourth
                    Reporter of Decisions of the United States Supreme Court. His sister, Sarah
                    Robinson Peters, 1785-1850, was for many years mistress of the family's Belmont
                    mansion.</p>
