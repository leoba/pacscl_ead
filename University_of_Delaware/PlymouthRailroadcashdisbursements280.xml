            <bioghist>
                <p>The Plymouth Railroad was chartered in 1836. Because the line ran through
                    agricultural areas, there were very few passengers, and the company owned very
                    few cars. The line was abandoned in the 1860s. It was revived in 1868 and
                    continued in operation until 1930.</p>
