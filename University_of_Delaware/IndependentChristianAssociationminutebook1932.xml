                <p>The Independent Christian Association of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was a
                    "Christian association of liberal character." The group was formed in 1877 and
                    held their first meeting in the First Independent Christian Church in
                    Marlborough. Subsequent meetings were held in other locations. The Reverend J.G.
                    Wilson was chairman of the association, and Professor R.D. Pease, of the Wagner
                    Institute, was its secretary.</p>
