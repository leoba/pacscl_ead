            <bioghist>
                <p>The Kingsessing Building Association was incorporated on June 12, 1868 in
                    Pennsylvania. Its Constitution states that it "shall have for its object the
                    accumulation of a fund by the saving of the members thereof, sufficient to
                    enable the Stockholders to build or purchase for themselves, respectively,
                    dwelling-houses or other real estate, or to invest in any lawful business that
                    may be deemed most advantageous." Membership in the association was open to
                    both men and women.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The volume consists of minutes of monthly meetings describing the selling of
                    shares, election of officers, and the financial outlook for the association.
                    Loose items include several annual reports, the constitution and by-laws of the
                    association, bonds that individuals had with the association, ballots, financial
                    reports, and additional meeting minutes.</p>
