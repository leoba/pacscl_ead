                <p>This collection consists of two ledgers of accounts, purchases, and receipts for
                    the roof slate business of Denis Conway and Thomas Scanlon. The first volume
                    covers the period 1850 to 1854. In this volume, alternating sections list
                    payments to Scanlon and Conway for work slating houses and other buildings and
                    disbursements and receipts for supplies and other expenses, including lists of
                    slates purchased by Conway and Scanlon. The second volume, 1855 to 1866,
                    includes payments made for labor, such as hauling of slates; lists of slates
                    purchased; and accounts of payments received for labor. There is an 1865 letter
                    inserted in the volume from Michael H. Quinn of the 3rd Pennsylvania Cavalry to
                    his uncle describing a Civil War battle near Petersburg. </p>
