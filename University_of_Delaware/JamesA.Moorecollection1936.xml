            <bioghist>
                <p>James A. Moore (d. 1999) was professor emeritus of chemistry and biochemistry at
                    the University of Delaware. During World War II, Moore served as an army private
                    at White Sands, New Mexico, with a group of expatriate German rocketeers, led by
                    Werner von Braun. After the war, Moore earned his doctoral degree at
                    Pennsylvania State University and worked for six years as a chemist for Parke
                    Davis in Detroit before joining the Universityâ€™s Department of Chemistry in
                    1955. Moore earned international recognition for his work as an organic chemist
                    specializing in novel heterocyclic systems, and was editor of the Journal of
                    Organic Chemistry for 25 years. He was a Gordon Conference section chairman for
                    many years and coauthor of a popular textbook in organic chemistry. He was
                    admired as a teacher and as a mentor and adviser to Ph.D. candidates and
                    postdoctoral associates. He retired from the University in 1988.</p>

                    Rita Hetzell on chemistry experiments, 1983. There are two published volumes in
                    the collection: John R. Dyer's Applications of Absorption Spectroscopy of
                    Organic Compounds, 1965; and Ralph Shriner and Reynold Fuson's The Systematic
                    Identification of Organic Compounds, 1940. The collection also includes
