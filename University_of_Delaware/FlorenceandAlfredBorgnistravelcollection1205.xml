            <bioghist>
                <p>Alfred and Florence Borgnis of New Castle, Delaware, started traveling in 1952
                    after ten years of marriage and two children. Alfred Borgnis was an auto
                    mechanic and his wife Florence was a homemaker and school teacher. They pulled a
                    31-foot house-trailer from New Castle to Yuma, Arizona. They lived in Yuma for
                    six months and in Los Angeles for three months before pulling their trailer over
                    the Rocky Mountains and returning home to New Castle a year later. On that trip
                    they visited the Grand Canyon, Disneyland, and many other sites in the West. In
                    1968, they took their first overseas trip, to Italy. In the following years,
                    they visited every state and most of the countries of Europe. They also visited
                    China, Australia, Columbia, Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Israel, the Soviet Union, the
                    Caribbean Islands, Mexico, and the Panama Canal.</p>
