                <p>The Delaware Humanities Forum exists to help connect the people of Delaware with
                    other people, cultures, and ideas. To accomplish that goal, the Forum hosts free
                    lectures and discussions to non-profit organizations, the public, and school
                    children; provides public historical education through reenactments and
                    traveling exhibits; sponsors lectures by scholars; provides grants to visiting
                    scholars, scholars in residence, and to other non-profits hosting their own
                    humanities programming. The Forum was formed in 1973. It is governed by a
                    27-member board of directors, and is run by a small professional staff. Rona G.
                    Finkelstein received her Ph.D. from the University of Rochester. She joined the
                    faculty at Delaware State College in 1964, becoming chairman of the philosophy
                    department the following year. In 1971, she taught in the Delaware Technical and
                    Community College parallel program, with the University of Delaware, and in
                    1972, became executive director of the Delaware Humanities Forum, retiring from
                    this position in 1980.</p>
