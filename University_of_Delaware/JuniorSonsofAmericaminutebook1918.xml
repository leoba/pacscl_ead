            <bioghist>
                <p>The Order of the Junior Sons of America was founded in 1847 in Philadelphia,
                    Pennsylvania, by Dr. Reynell Coates (1802-1886). Dr. Coates was a surgeon,
                    scientist, statesman, naturalist, teacher, poet, lecturer and essayist, and
                    wished to found a fraternity for American boys to serve as a "High School of
                    American Patriotism." The organization was open to American boys aged sixteen
                    to twenty-one years of age. Upon turning twenty-one, their membership would be
                    transferred to the United Sons of America, the parent organization of the Junior
                    Sons. The first meeting of the Junior Sons of America was conducted on December
                    10, 1847, on Ridge Road, near Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia. Towards the
                    conclusion of the Civil War, a convention was held by several Brothers of the
                    Junior Sons of America in Norristown, Pennsylvania, to reorganize the Order. It
                    was at this time that the name was changed to the Patriotic Order of the Sons of
                    America (P.O.S. of A.) and the age limit of 21 was discontinued.</p>
