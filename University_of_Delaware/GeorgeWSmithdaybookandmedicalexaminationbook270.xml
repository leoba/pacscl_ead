            <bioghist>
                <p>George W. Smith was the son of Judge Bartine Smith of Haverford, Pennsylvania. He
                    was a medical doctor and a member of Crescent Lodge, No. 493. He practiced at
                    1809 N. 12th Street and 1302 Spruce Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At the
                    time of his death in 1910 he lived at 806 North Broad Street.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of two volumes. The daybook of patient accounts,
                    1875-1876, has entries which list the date, the patient's name, the prescription
                    given, what the illness or symptoms were, and the charges made. It also includes
                    a poem by Smith titled, "Our College Flag." The medical examination book
                    includes materials from the late 1880s to 1910 and is indexed by name. The bulk
                    of the volume lists the date, patient name, patient address, patient symptoms,
                    and sometimes the medicine or treatment given. The back of the medical
                    examination book includes various writings by Smith such as toasts, songs and
                    club histories for the Oxford Club and Crescent Lodge #493 (some printed) and a
                    valedictory address for the Hahnemanian Institute, as well as some poems written
                    by J.G. Bryant.</p>
