            <bioghist>
                <p>Samuel Delany, also known as "Chip", was born to a prominent black family in
                    1942 and raised in Harlem. Delany attended the Dalton School and the Bronx High
                    School of Science. Delany was a published science fiction author by the age of
                    20. He published nine well-regarded science fiction novels between 1962 and
                    1968, as well as several prize-winning short stories. His most popular novel,
                    Dhalgren, was published in 1975. His main literary project through the late
                    1970s and 1980s was the Return to Nevèrÿon series, the overall title of the four
                    volumes and also the title of the fourth and final book. Delany has published
                    several autobiographical/semi-autobiographical accounts of his life as a black
                    and gay writer, including his Hugo award winning autobiography, The Motion of
                    Light in Water. Since 1988, Delany has been a professor at several universities
                    including the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, the University at Buffalo,
                    and Temple University.</p>
