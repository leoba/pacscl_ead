                <p>The Philadelphia Wood Committee for the North Part of the City provided firewood
                    to families in need. John De la Mater, Isaac Davis, and Amos Hoops were the
                    members of the committee for 1817. Joseph Rotch, Joseph Cresson, and Nathan
                    Trotter were the members of the committee for 1818.</p>

                <p>The collection consists of two small volumes. The volumes list the names of poor
                    people in Northern Philadelphia who received firewood, the number of units
                    ordered (usually 1), and the supplier. Wood suppliers include Isaac Davis, Amos
                    Hoops, William Gerhard, Jacob Billmeyer and Joseph Howell. The 1817 volume lists
                    974 names and the 1818 volume lists 695 names.</p>
