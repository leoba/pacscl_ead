            <bioghist>
                <p>Roger E. Nathan (d. 2005) of Woodstown, New Jersey, was a significant help to the
                    Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey boundary commissions during the
                    1980s and 1990s when the Delaware Boundary Commission was reestablishing
                    Delaware's boundary monuments and signing new boundary agreements with
                    neighboring states. Roger Nathan visited every monument and provided the
                    commissions with photographic evidence and written reports on the condition of
                    all 179 monuments. He was the author of East of the Mason-Dixon Line, A History
                    of the Delaware Boundaries.</p>
