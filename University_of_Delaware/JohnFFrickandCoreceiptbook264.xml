            <bioghist>
                <p>John Frick and Co. was a shipping firm which operated out of Lumberton, New
                    Jersey.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a receipt book for John F. Frick and Co., covering shipments between 1851
                    and 1858. Entries from 1851 to 1855 are written on the receipt stubs, and list
                    goods shipped, the date of the shipment, the name of the ship and captain
                    carrying the goods, and the weight of the shipment. The remainder of the
                    entries, from 1855 to 1858, are written on the receipts themselves, and list the
                    same information. Most of the shipments are of iron pipes, elbows, branches.
                    Shipments were made primarily to locations on the Eastern seaboard, mostly
                    Brooklyn.</p>
