            <bioghist>
                <p>Kim Rogers Burdick received her bachelor's degree from State University of New
                    York at Cortland, and an M.P.A. in Agency Management from the College of Urban
                    Affairs at the University of Delaware. From 1981 to 1989, Burdick served as the
                    coordinator of the Delaware Folklife Project. During that time she developed a
                    statewide volunteer group whose goal was to document, promote, and preserve
                    Delaware's traditional culture. As House-Senate Liaison in the Delaware
                    Legislature, Kim Rogers Burdick designed Delaware's Coastal Heritage Greenway
                    proposal, coordinated the 1991 Managed Growth Conference for the General
                    Assembly, and initiated the establishment of Sussex County's Business People for
                    the Bays citizens' action group. Prior to this position, she served for two
                    years as Legislative Fellow to the House Natural Resources and Hazardous Waste
                    Committees. Burdick has further advocated the creation of Delaware's Folklife
                    program by lecturing extensively on Delaware's cultural history, assisting local
                    historical societies, and educating Delaware teachers.</p>
