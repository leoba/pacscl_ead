            <bioghist>
                <p>Charlotte Shedd was born in Austria in 1913 as Charlotte Kraus, and became a
                    student of the performing arts. In 1938, she was denied the right to appear on
                    stage because of the Nazi occupation of Austria, the Nuremberg Laws, and her
                    father's Jewish background. On Christmas Eve 1938, she escaped to America with a
                    nearly expired Austrian passport and began her singing career. Ms. Kraus
                    struggled with her singing career until she married Clifford Shedd and settled
                    in Wilmington, Delaware. There she succeeded as a radio personality, hosting
                    four programs on station WDEL. In addition to hosting classical music programs,
                    she was known for her interviews with local, national, and international
                    personalities, her numerous awards, and her persistent editorializing about the
                    importance of American liberties, in contrast with the repression she
                    experienced in occupied Austria. In 1997, she published Thank you, America her
                    autobiographical account of overcoming the hardships of immigration and the
                    opportunities she enjoyed in America, her adopted country.</p>
