            <bioghist>
                <p>Eastern State Penitentiary opened in 1829 and was designed by John Haviland. Its
                    revolutionary system of incarceration, dubbed the Pennsylvania System,
                    originated and encouraged solitary confinement as a form of rehabilitation.
                    Eastern State's radial floor plan and system of solitary confinement became the
                    model for over 300 prisons worldwide. Eastern State was viewed as a progressive
                    reform in that it eliminated many of the excesses of physical punishment in
                    colonial America. Despite this, it was widely believed (then and now) to have
                    caused significant mental illness among its prisoners due to its solitary
                    confinement. The system quickly collapsed due to overcrowding problems. By 1913,
                    Eastern State officially abandoned the solitary system and operated as a
                    congregate prison until it closed in 1970.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of three volumes of patient information kept at the
                    infirmary of the Eastern States Penitentiary from 1840 to 1868. The volumes
                    present monthly summaries of cases, and provide some remarks based on post
                    mortem examinations. The earliest volume (1840-1843) gives daily tallies of
                    patients, their diseases, and the progress of their diseases. The volume
                    includes monthly summaries of patients, with a separate tally for
                    African-American patients. In this volume there are also yearly tabular views of
                    the cases of African-American prisoners and one tabular view of the cases of
                    white prisoners in 1841. The other two volumes (1844-1855 and 1855-1868) consist
                    of monthly summaries of patients, their diseases, race, gender, and progress of
                    the diseases. These two volumes also include postmortem reports.</p>
