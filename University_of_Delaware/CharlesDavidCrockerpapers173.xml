            <bioghist>
                <p>Charles David Crocker (1917-2004) was an agronomist for the U.S. Agency for
                    International Development (USAID) from 1957 to 1972. He received his degree in
                    agronomy from the University of Delaware in 1938, and afterwards worked in soil
                    conservation and with the Civilian Conservation Corps in Maryland. He was an
                    officer in the U.S. Navy, and served in the Pacific during World War II and
                    worked in intelligence during the Korean War. In his work for USAID, he
                    contributed to soil conservation, reforestation, and crop improvement programs
                    in Korea (1957-1961), Cambodia (1961-1963), Vietnam (1963-1965 and 1969-1972),
                    Turkey (1965-1966), and Ghana (1966-1968). After his retirement from USAID,
                    Crocker sold real estate in Arlington, Virginia (1972-2000).</p>
