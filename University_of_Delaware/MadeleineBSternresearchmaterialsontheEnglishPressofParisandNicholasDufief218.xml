            <bioghist>
                <p>The rare book dealer and writer Madeleine B. Stern was born July 1, 1912, in New
                    York City, New York. She was educated at Barnard College (A.B., 1932) and
                    Columbia University (M.A., 1934). In 1945 she began dealing rare books in a
                    long-lasting partnership with Leona Rostenberg, and the two have collaborated on
                    several memoirs that record their experiences in the book trade. Stern’s
                    scholarly work includes several books and numerous articles on rare books,
                    publishing history, women’s issues, nineteenth-century literature, and several
                    biographies, including The Life of Margaret Fuller (1942) and Louisa May Alcott
                    (1950). Stern is a member of many bibliographic and literary associations:
                    Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America, Modern Language Association of
                    America, American Printing History Association, Manuscript Society, Authors
                    League of America, and the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers. She
                    received a Guggenheim fellowship, 1943-45; the Medalie Award, Barnard College,
                    1982; and an American Printing History Association Award (with Leona
                    Rostenberg), 1983. Nicholas Gouin Dufief (1776-1834), was a Franco-American
                    bookseller and book-agent for Thomas Jefferson for whom he supplied many
                    desiderata and with whom he carried on an extensive bibliophilic correspondence.
                    Dufief also played a role in the dispersal of Benjamin Franklin's library and of
                    the Westover (Virginia) library of William Byrd I and William Byrd II. The
                    English Press of Paris, was operated by John Hurford Stone, a wealthy English
                    coal merchant and an enthusiastic believer in the French Revolution.</p>
