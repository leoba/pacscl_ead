            <bioghist>
                <p>John Beverley Nichols (1898-1983), was an English writer, playwright, actor,
                    novelist and composer. He went to school at Marlborough College, and went to
                    Balliol College, Oxford University, and was President of the Oxford Union and
                    editor of Isis. Between his first novel, Prelude, published in 1920, and
                    Twilight in 1982, he wrote more than 60 works, including six novels, five
                    detective mysteries, four children's stories, six plays, and no fewer than six
                    autobiographies. Nichols's long-term partner was Cyril Butcher.</p>
