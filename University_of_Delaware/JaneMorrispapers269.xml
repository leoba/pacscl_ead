            <bioghist>
                <p>Jane Morris (1813-1897) was the youngest daughter of Israel W. Morris (1778-1870)
                    and Mary Hollingsworth Morris. She lived at Greenhill Farm, Overbrook. Israel
                    Wistar Morris (1833-1909) was the son of Dr. Caspar and Ann (Cheston) Morris. He
                    was the President of the Locust Mountain &amp; Coal Company and a land agent for
                    the Lehigh Valley Coal Company.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of family papers of the Morris, Cheston, Galloway,
                    Hollingsworth, and Buckley families. Materials include typescript copies of
                    wills, family anecdotes, and genealogies. Some of the records appear to be
                    original family history research, possibly created by Israel W. Morris or Jane
                    Morris. The collection includes typescript or printed wills of Wistar Morris,
                    Galloway Cheston, Jane Morris, Israel W. Morris. The collection also includes
                    letters (1905-1908) from Mrs. Clapham Murray to Israel Wistar Morris regarding
                    his requests for information on the Morris, Hollingsworth, and Cheston families;
                    and a copy of a brief title to Greenhill Farm, Overbrook, and a survey map of
                    the proposed subdivision of Greenhill Farm.</p>
