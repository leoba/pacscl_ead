            <bioghist>
                <p>The Poor Richard Club was a Philadelphia social and professional organization for
                    those in the advertising business ("it is composed of men who buy advertising,
                    men who make advertising, men who sell advertising"). It was formed in 1904,
                    and in 1907 established its location at 239 Camac Street in Philadelphia.
                    Beginning in 1934, the club awarded its Gold Medal of Achievement to notable
                    business and political figures. The club was associated with the Charles Morris
                    Price School of Advertising and Journalism.</p>
