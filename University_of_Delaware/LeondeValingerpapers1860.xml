            <bioghist>
                <p>Leon de Valinger (d. 2000) served as the State Archivist of Delaware from 1941 to
                    1972. His contributions to establishing and strengthening Delaware's public
                    archives program were so significant that, in 1989, the General Assembly renamed
                    the Hall of Records building in Dover in his honor. He was a founding member of
                    the Society of American Archivists and the author of numerous books, articles,
                    and pamphlets on Delaware history. He played a key role in the preservation of
                    the John Dickinson Mansion Museum, Buena Vista, Woodburn, the Old State House,
                    and other historic sites in Delaware.</p>
