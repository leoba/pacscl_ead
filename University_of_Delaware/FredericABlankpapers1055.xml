            <bioghist>
                <p>Frederic A. Blank (d. 1992) was a New York businessman. He served in the army
                    during World War I, then returned home to his previous career as an export
                    manager. In 1926, he worked in the wall-covering industry, and invented a
                    washable, non-fading wall-covering. In 1940, he was appointed to the American
                    and Foreign Panel of Arbitrators in the U.S. by the American Arbitration
                    Association of New York. He also taught institutional decoration at Cornell
                    University (1945) and joined the Executive Association of Greater New York
                    (1945), becoming the vice president in 1948. He retired to Wilmington, Delaware,
                    in 1949.</p>
