                <p>This collection consists of two related volumes. One ledger lists sundries and
                    cash expenditures, 1826-1829. There are payments for a range of items, including
                    house expenses, fuel, the education of Scott's children, and charitable
                    contributions to organizations such as the Guardians of the Poor. The ledger is
                    organized chronologically by month and year. The other ledger groups the
                    expenses by creditor and type and covers 1825-1829. Within each group, listings
                    are chronological and there is a name index to the volume.</p>
