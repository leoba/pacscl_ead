                <p>The Delaware Section of the American Chemical Society was organized in the fall
                    of 1917, with the DuPont Experimental Station Chemical Society as a nucleus. The
                    first officers of the Section were Lammot du Pont, as Chairman; R. P. Calvert,
                    as Secretary; and C. M. A. Stine and Firman Thompson, as Councilors. The charter
                    for the Section, received from the American Chemical Society on December 28,
                    1917, embraced the territory of Delaware and Salem County, New Jersey. The South
                    Jersey members petitioned for withdrawal in March 1920, and the petition was
                    accepted, since it was impractical for them to attend meetings in
                    Wilmington.</p>
