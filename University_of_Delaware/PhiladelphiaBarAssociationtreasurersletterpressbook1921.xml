                <p>The Philadelphia Bar Association, founded in 1802, is America's first chartered
                    metropolitan bar association. Its founders and early leaders included several of
                    the nation's founders. It was originally formed by a small group of Philadelphia
                    lawyers who gathered together to share law books and professional resources.
                    Founded as the Law Library Company of Philadelphia it was later incorporated as
                    the Law Association and then the Bar Association. Over the years its members
                    have included some of the nation's most prominent lawyers, judges, public
                    servants, business, civic and community leaders.</p>
