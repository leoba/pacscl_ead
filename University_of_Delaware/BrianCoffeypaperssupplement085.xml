            <bioghist>
                <p>Brian Coffey (1905-1995) was an Irish poet and publisher. His work was informed
                    by his Catholicism and by his background in science and philosophy, and his
                    connection to surrealism. For these reasons, he is seen as being closer to an
                    intellectual European Catholic tradition than to mainstream Irish Catholic
                    culture. Two of his long poems published in later years, Advent (1975) and Death
                    of Hektor (1979), are widely considered to be among the most important works in
                    the canon of Irish poetic modernism. He also ran Advent, a small press, during
                    the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
