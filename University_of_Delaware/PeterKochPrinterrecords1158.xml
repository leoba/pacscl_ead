            <bioghist>
                <p>Peter Rutledge Koch is a San Francisco Bay Area printer and one of the leading
                    modern printers and designers of the fine press book. Born in Montana, he
                    traveled to Europe and Africa before completing a bachelor's degree in
                    philosophy at the University of Montana. He then spent time in Paris and
                    Amsterdam, where he was heavily influenced by the work of Andr√©e Breton and Max
                    Ernst. Three years later he launched his first publication, Montana Gothic, a
                    poetry journal which was awarded the Pushcart Prize for the Best of Small
                    Presses. From there, his career took off, but his work remained grounded in
                    geography and a sense of place, filled with western themes, images, and even
                    found-objects.</p>
