            <bioghist>
                <p>William Hening may have been the proprietor of a general store in the
                    mid-nineteenth century, possibly in Maryland. He also appears to have performed
                    various services, such as shoe repair, letting land for grazing of livestock,
                    and house repairs. Customers listed in the book include Elizabeth Knight, on
                    whose property Hening may have lived, Elijah Marker, George Marker, Samuel
                    Wormley, Enoch Jinkins, and Dr. W.W. Walls.</p>
