            <bioghist>
                <p>The Keystone View Co. was formed in 1892 in Meadville, Pennsylvania by B.L.
                    Singley, a former salesman at Underwood &amp; Underwood. This company was a
                    major publisher of stereographs. In 1898 they organized an Education Department
                    which produced boxed sets for school instruction with images and descriptive
                    text illustrating culture, industry, commerce and politics. Although the company
                    hired its own professional photographers, they also purchased rights to other
                    negatives including several series of Underwood and Underwood negatives in 1912.
                    Orders for Keystone sets continued to be filled by the company as late as
                    1970.</p>
