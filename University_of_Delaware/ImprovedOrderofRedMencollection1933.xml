            <bioghist>
                <p>The Improved Order of Red Men is a Fraternal Organization established in
                    Baltimore, Maryland, in 1834. Their rituals and regalia are modeled after those
                    used by native people of North America. The order claims direct descent from the
                    Sons of Liberty, noting that the Sons participated in the Boston Tea Party
                    dressed as Native Americans. Their ladies' auxiliary is the Degree of
                    Pocahontas. They sponsor two youth organizations, the Degree of Hiawatha for
                    boys and the Degree of Anona for girls. At its height, in 1935, the organization
                    claimed a membership of about half a million.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of four volumes from various tribes of the order. Three
                    volumes are member registers, which list the names, occupations, and ages of new
                    members. Member registers are for Baltimore [?], 1855-1867; the Penobscot Tribe
                    #70, circa 1890; and Philadelphia, 1867-1891. The other volume in the collection
                    is a receipt book for the Relief Committee of the Wingohocking Tribe #33 of
                    Frankford, Pennsylvania, 1867-1870. Entries in this volume record the name of
                    the member, date of the payment, and amount paid.</p>
