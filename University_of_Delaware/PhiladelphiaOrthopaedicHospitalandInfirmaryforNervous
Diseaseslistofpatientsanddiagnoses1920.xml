            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Orthopaedic Hospital was organized on October 1, 1867, and
                    incorporated on December 2 of that same year. In 1870, an Infirmary for Nervous
                    Diseases was added. The hospital was established to treat patients with bodily
                    deformities or diseases of the nervous system. It accepted charity and paying
                    patients and also treated, at daily clinics, patients not requiring admission.
                    The hospital opened at 15 South 9th Street, then moved to the northwest corner
                    of 17th and Summer streets. On July 1, 1938, it merged with the University of
                    Pennsylvania and became part of the University Hospital. Dr. Gwilym G. Davis,
                    M.D. (1857-1918), was Professor of Orthopedic Surgery and Associate Professor of
                    Applied Anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

                    structures, and there is one photograph of a patient's legs and feet.</p>
