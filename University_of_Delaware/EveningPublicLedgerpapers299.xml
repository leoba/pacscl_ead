            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Public Ledger was published from March 25, 1836 to January 1942.
                    Founded by William M. Swain, Arunah S. Abell, and Azariah H. Simmons, and edited
                    by Swain, it was the first penny paper in Philadelphia. In 1864, it was sold to
                    George William Childs and Anthony J. Drexel. In 1902, New York Times owner
                    Adolph Ochs bought the paper, merged in the Philadelphia Times (which he had
                    bought the previous year), and installed his brother George as editor. In 1913,
                    Cyrus Curtis purchased the paper, launching an evening edition in 1914. On April
                    16, 1934, the morning and Sunday editions were merged into The Philadelphia
                    Inquirer (also held by the heirs of Curtis), but the paper continued an
                    independent life as the Evening Public Ledger. In 1941, the Evening Public
                    Ledger was sold to Robert Cresswell, formerly of the New York Herald Tribune.
                    Mounting debts brought on a court-ordered liquidation, and the paper ceased
                    publication in January, 1942.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of correspondence and business records of the Evening Public
                    Ledger. The correspondence largely relates to circulation and subscriptions and
                    there is some correspondence with advertisers. There is also a series of letters
                    from a family whose daughter may have been harassed by a Ledger delivery driver.
                    The collection includes several publicity photographs.</p>
