                <p>Karl Dittmer (d. 1994) was Dean of the College of Science at Portland State
                    University. From 1958 to 1964, he was also the Program Administrator of the
                    Petroleum Research Fund, a trust established by seven major oil companies in
                    1944 to foster "advanced scientific education and fundamental research in the
                    'petroleum field.'" This fund was administered by the American Chemical
                    Society.</p>
