                <p>The American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC), founded in
                    1921, is an organization that promotes knowledge of the application of dyes and
                    chemicals in the textile industry and encourages research on chemical processes
                    related to the dye and textile industries.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists primarily of bound volumes of circulars from the General
                    Dyestuffs Corporation. These volumes were collected by the AATCC. Each volume is
                    organized by color, and includes technical data about the dyes, as well as
                    samples of dyed fabric and yarn. The collection also includes a scrapbook of
                    fabrics woven by George Manton, three photo albums of exhibits from the AATCC
                    Silver Jubilee in 1946, a ledger of dye samples from various sources, a
                    scrapbook of fabric samples showing results of washing/fading tests, and a bound
                    "Pre-War Color Index."</p>
