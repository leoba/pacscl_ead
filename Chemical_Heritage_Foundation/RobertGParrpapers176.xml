            <bioghist>
                <p>Robert G. Parr was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1921. He attended Brown
                    University and did his graduate work at the University of Minnesota under Bryce
                    Crawford. He subsequently taught at Carnegie Institute of Technology, Johns
                    Hopkins University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Robert
                    G. Parr was an important theoretical chemist. In concert with his pupil Rudolph
                    Pariser and in conjunction with the research of Sir John Pople he contributed to
                    the formulation of what came to be called "the P-P-P method" for predicting
                    electronic spectra. In the latter part of his career he devoted his energy to
                    the Density Functional Theory. Robert G. Parr is now retired.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of papers from the career of Robert G. Parr. Materials
                    include: research notes and calculations, correspondence, career records, files
                    on overseas speaking engagements, publications lists, curricula vitae
                    (1975-1998), grant proposals and progress reports, progress and technical
                    reports from projects at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University
                    of Chicago, and Oxford, documents relating to awards and honors, and records of
                    membership in scientific societies. Some of the research notes relate to his
                    work on the Density-Functional Theory, but there are files on many other topics
                    as well.</p>
