            <bioghist>
                <p>Charles Henry Wabnitz (1916-2004) was a biochemist at the Nichols General
                    Veterans Administration Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, before becoming the
                    Clinical Chemist at the laboratory of the Jewish Hospital in Louisville, where
                    he worked until his retirement. He became a member of the The American
                    Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) in 1949, about a year after the
                    association was organized.</p>
