                <p>The American Chemical Society (ACS), founded in 1876, is a self-governed
                    individual membership organization that consists of more than 158,000 members at
                    all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry. The Division of Industrial
                    &amp; Engineering Chemistry (I&amp;EC) is one of the 33 technical divisions
                    within the ACS. Founded in 1908, it was the first division organized in the ACS.
                    Its main focus is "helping individuals convert science into commercially
                    relevant products and processes."</p>
