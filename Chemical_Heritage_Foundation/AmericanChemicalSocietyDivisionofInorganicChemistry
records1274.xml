                <p>The American Chemical Society (ACS), founded in 1876, is a self-governed
                    individual membership organization that consists of more than 158,000 members at
                    all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry. The Division of Inorganic
                    Chemistry is one of the 33 technical divisions within the ACS. The division's
                    goals include advancing the science of inorganic chemistry, providing networking
                    opportunities for inorganic chemists, arranging programs and symposia on special
                    topics and for the national meetings of the ACS, and promoting the teaching of
                    inorganic chemistry at the undergraduate and graduate levels.</p>
