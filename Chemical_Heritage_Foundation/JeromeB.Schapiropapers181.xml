                <p>Jerome Schapiro (b. 1930) was the president of Dixo Company, which was founded by
                    his father, Sol Schapiro, in 1926. Dixo manufactured chemicals for the
                    drycleaning industry and performed testing for drycleaning operations. Schapiro
                    was an active member of several standards organizations, serving on a variety of
                    committees focusing on textiles and chemical detergents. These include: the
                    American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Committees on Textiles and
                    Detergents; American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC);
                    American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Board of Directors, Executive
                    Committee, and Consumer Council; International Organization for Standardization
                    (ISO) Technical Committees on Surface Active Agents, Consumer Questions,
                    Consumer Policy, and Textiles; and the National Institute of Drycleaning.</p>
