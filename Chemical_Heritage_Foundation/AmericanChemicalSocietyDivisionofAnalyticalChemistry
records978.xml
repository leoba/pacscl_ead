                <p>The American Chemical Society (ACS), founded in 1876, is a self-governed
                    individual membership organization that consists of more than 158,000 members at
                    all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry. The Division of Analytical
                    Chemistry is one of the 33 technical divisions within the ACS. This division
                    promotes analytical chemistry in all of its aspects by organizing symposia,
                    holding programs during ACS national meetings, and sponsoring other activities
                    to provide professional development opportunities to members.</p>
