            <bioghist>
                <p>In 1982, the Center for the History of Chemistry (CHOC) was launched as a pilot
                    project of the University of Pennsylvania and the American Chemical Society
                    (ACS). In 1987 CHOC was incorporated as a not-for-profit organization, now named
                    the National Foundation for the History of Chemistry, by joint action of the ACS
                    and AIChE, the Center's third sponsor. In 1992 the Chemical Heritage Foundation
                    (CHF) assumed its present name to better reflect the interdisciplinary nature of
                    the sciences and industries it serves and the widening public scope of its
                    activities. From 1986 to 1987, Bruce V. Lewenstein was Public Education Officer
                    at CHOC.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of records of the Public Education Office during
                    Lewenstein's tenure. Materials include public outreach materials, such as texts
                    of talks and articles, press releases, responses to individual inquiries to CHF,
                    correspondence with other institutions, and media outlets, frequently asked
                    questions, and information on chemical education resources for schools. The
                    collection also contains a series of topical files on computer systems, mailing
                    lists, ISBNs, and chemistry publications, as well as a ChemCom textbook,
                    published by the ACS.</p>
