            <bioghist>
                <p>The Advisory Council on College Chemistry (ACCC) was formed in 1962 as an effort
                    to improve college chemistry instruction. The program sought support for
                    experimental programs, and formed study groups on general chemistry, curriculum
                    and advanced courses, teaching aids, teacher development and courses for
                    non-scientists. The ACCC was sponsored by the National Science Foundation from
                    1962 to 1968.</p>
