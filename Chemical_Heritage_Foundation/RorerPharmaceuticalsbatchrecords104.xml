            <bioghist>
                <p>Rorer Pharmaceuticals, established in 1910, began as a drug repackaging
                    operation. By 1927, when the company was incorporated, it was manufacturing its
                    own pharmaceuticals. In 1949, Rorer introduced Maalox, which became its
                    strongest selling product.</p>
