                <p>The Monte Carlo Integration Computer (MCIC) is a special purpose digital computer
                    that utilizes the Monte Carlo integration method for simulating dynamic
                    equilibrium and rate processes. The computer was designed for instructional
                    purposes to allow chemistry students to simulate these processes at both the
                    macroscopic (concentration of species) and microscopic (atomic and molecular)
                    levels. The MCIC was originally developed in 1970-72 through a dissertation
                    study at Temple University by Dean A. Wood under the direction of Frank X.
                    Sutman. </p>

                    and Evaluation of a Teaching Aid," and a binder entitled "Monte Carlo
                    Integration Computer: Data collection and graphical dispay of concentration vs.
                    time relationships for various rate and equilibrium processes as simulated by
