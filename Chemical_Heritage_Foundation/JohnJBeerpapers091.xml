                    the University of Delaware. He is the author of books and articles on alchemy,
                    the history of chemistry, the professionalization of science, and the German dye

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of Beer's research files, organized by topic, and a
                    small selection of correspondence. The research files contain clippings from
                    journals, copies of papers, and a few handwritten notes, and cover subjects such
                    as physical chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology, the chemical
                    industry, teaching the history of chemistry, and the Chemical Revolution
                    1775-1825. The collection includes several information booklets in French from
                    Societe des Usines Chimiques, Rhone-Poulenc. Also included is a fabric sample
                    apparently dyed with William Perkin's "mauve," the first synthetic dye.</p>
