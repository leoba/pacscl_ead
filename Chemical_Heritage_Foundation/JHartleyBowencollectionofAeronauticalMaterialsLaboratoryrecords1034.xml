            <bioghist>
                <p>During the 1940s and 1950s, J. Hartley Bowen (d. 1999) was the Technical Director
                    of the Aeronautical Materials Laboratory (AML), which was formerly based at the
                    Naval Air Engineering Center in Philadelphia. The AML conducted tests of the
                    effects of radiation on nonmetalic substances, such as rubber and plastic. The
                    lab also studied performance characteristics of preservatives used on mechanical
                    components to prevent corrosion and rust. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection includes plans and specifications for facilities for nuclear
                    radiation studies; minutes from meetings of the Nuclear Energy Programs Advisory
                    Committee; materials relating to the physical relocation of the Aeronautical
                    Materials Laboratory, including blueprints; specifications and reports on
                    preservative agents and materials for aircraft, engines, and spare parts; a
                    report on "Operation Crossroads," a series of tests on an aircraft that had
                    been exposed to radiation; memos and news clippings about the Navy's plans to
                    build a nuclear-powered seaplane; and a printed copy of the Hearing Before the
                    US Congressional Subcommittee on Research and Development of the Joint Committee
                    on Atomic Energy, held in July of 1959.</p>
