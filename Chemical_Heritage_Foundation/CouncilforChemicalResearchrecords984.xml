                <p>The Council for Chemical Research (CCR) is an organization based in Washington,
                    DC, whose membership represents industry, academia, and government. CCR was
                    formed in 1979 to promote cooperation in basic research and encourage high
                    quality education in the chemical sciences and engineering.</p>

                <p>This collection documents two conferences held in 1979 and 1980: the First
                    Midland Conference on Advances in Chemical Science and Technology and the Second
                    Bethlehem-Lehigh Conference on Cooperative Advances in Chemical Science and
                    Technology. Malcolm E. Pruitt, a vice president of research and development at
                    Dow Chemical Company, was on the steering committee for the second of these
                    conferences, and he collected these materials. Following the second conference,
                    a committee was formed to structure a new organization, the CRC. The collection
                    also includes proceedings from the 10th Conference on Cooperative Advances in
                    1988 and the Program for CCR's 1989 annual meeting.</p>
