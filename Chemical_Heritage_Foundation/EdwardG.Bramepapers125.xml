            <bioghist>
                <p>Edward G. Brame, Jr. (1927-2002) was the president of the CECON Group, a chemical
                    and engineering consulting firm. He and several friends founded the company in
                    1985. Prior to that he worked for the DuPont Company for 27 years. A respected
                    and accomplished spectroscopist, Brame was the editor of Applied Spectroscopy
                    Reviews for 30 years, editor in chief of Practical Spectroscopy for 22 years,
                    and associate editor of Applied Spectroscopy for five years. Brame was
                    interested in paranormal phenomena, and his work in spectroscopy intersected
                    with his investigations in parapsychology.</p>
