            <bioghist>
                <p>Izaak Maurits (Piet) Kolthoff (1894- 1993) was born in Holland and received his
                    Ph.D. in 1918 from the University of Utrecht. He remained there as Lecturer
                    until 1927, when he took the position of Professor of Analytical Chemistry at
                    the University of Minnesota. He remained active in research throughout his
                    career. He was made Professor Emeritus in 1962. He published more than 950
                    papers during his career. Herbert Laitinen (1915-1991) joined the faculty of the
                    University of Illinois in 1940, the same year he received his doctorate from the
                    University of Minnesota where he studied under I. M. Kolthoff. For several
                    years, Laitinen taught inorganic and general chemistry; in 1947 he began
                    teaching analytical chemistry. He became head of the Analytical Chemistry
                    division in 1953. He was the editor of Analytical Chemistry from 1966 to 1979.
                    Laitinen had varied research interests. He was a leader in synthetic rubber
                    research during the Second World War. He also conducted research in
                    electrochemistry, polarography, diffusion, polarization of microelectrodes,
                    environmental science, and surface chemistry. </p>
