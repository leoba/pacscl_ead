                <p>The American Institute of Chemists (AIC), founded in 1923, is a professional
                    association of chemists. The AIC fosters the advancement of the chemical
                    profession through its awards and certification programs, meetings,
                    publications, and public relations activities. New Jersey Institute of Chemists
                    is the local New Jersey branch of the AIC. Homer J. Hall, was a research chemist
                    at Esso (Exxon). He was the national secretary of the AIC and was president of
                    the local New Jersey chapter of the AIC, the New Jersey Institute of Chemists
                    (NJIC). In 1971, Hall was appointed to be the AIC's representative to the
                    American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).</p>
