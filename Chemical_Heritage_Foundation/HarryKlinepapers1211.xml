            <bioghist>
                <p>Harry Kline (d. 1964) studied chemical engineering at the Case Institute of
                    Technology. In the mid 1920s, Kline was awarded a fellowship at the Mellon
                    Institute, where he developed an interest in phenolic resins. From the late
                    1920s to 1943, he worked for the Bakelite Company in Bound Brook, New Jersey. In
                    1943, he became the Director of Phenolic Plastics with Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.
                    From 1950 until his death, Kline served Reichhold Chemicals as the Vice
                    President in charge of the Phenolic Plastics Division.</p>

                <p>The collection consists of lectures, research reports, laboratory notes,
                    correspondence, and graphs. Most of the materials were generated while Kline was
                    working for the Bakelite Corporation, though there is also a notebook of
                    laboratory notes from Kline's fellowship at the Mellon Institute. The majority
                    of the items concern phenolic resins, varnishes, and plastics.</p>
