            <bioghist>
                <p>Dr. Marvin Margoshes (b. 1925) graduated in 1950 from the Polytechnic Institute
                    of Brooklyn with a B.S. in Chemistry. In 1953 he was awarded a Ph.D in Physical
                    Chemistry from Iowa State College. He was Editor of Spectrochimica Acta B and
                    served on the Editorial Advisory Board and the Instrumentation Advisory Board of
                    Analytical Chemistry. He has been a member of the Society for Applied
                    Spectroscopy since its inception in 1958.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of eight programs from symposia of the Eastern
                    Analytical Symposium (EAS), from 1960 to 1968 (1965 is missing). EAS is
                    sponsored by the American Chemical Society, the Society for Applied
                    Spectroscopy, and the Metropolitan Microchemical Society. The EAS symposia
                    provided a forum for presentation and discussion of topics of interest in the
                    fields of analytical chemistry and applied spectroscopy. The programs list
                    exhibitors and abstracts of papers given. One is annotated, presumably by
                    Margoshes.</p>
