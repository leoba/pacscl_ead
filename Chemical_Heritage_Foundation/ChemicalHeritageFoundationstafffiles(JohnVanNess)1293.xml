            <bioghist>
                <p>In 1982, the Center for the History of Chemistry (CHOC) was launched as a pilot
                    project of the University of Pennsylvania and the American Chemical Society
                    (ACS). In 1987 CHOC was incorporated as a not-for-profit organization, now named
                    the National Foundation for the History of Chemistry, by joint action of the ACS
                    and AIChE, the Center's third sponsor. In 1992 the Chemical Heritage Foundation
                    (CHF) assumed its present name to better reflect the interdisciplinary nature of
                    the sciences and industries it serves and the widening public scope of its
                    activities. John Van Ness is CHF's Vice President for Administration.</p>
