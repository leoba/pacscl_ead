                <p>The American Chemical Society (ACS), founded in 1876, is a self-governed
                    individual membership organization that consists of more than 158,000 members at
                    all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry. The Cellulose, Paper and
                    Textile Division (CELL) was a technical division within the ACS focused on the
                    identification, processing, and dissemination of knowledge related to the
                    science and technology of renewable materials and biopolymers. (In 2001, it was
                    renamed the Cellulose and Renewable Materials Division.)</p>
