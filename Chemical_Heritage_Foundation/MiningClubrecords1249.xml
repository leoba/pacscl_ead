            <bioghist>
                <p>In 1929, Allen Rogers, Lucius Mayer, and Raymond Brooks formed the Mining Club
                    for the purpose of holding monthly luncheons in New York for mining engineers.
                    This club became a place for mining men to meet, socialize, and discuss business
                    matters. Talks on a variety of mining-related subjects, such as the progress of
                    mining, metallurgical and petroleum problems, and equipment, were given at the
                    monthly luncheons.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of the records of the Mining Club. Materials include
                    correspondence, meeting minutes, financial statements, membership lists, and
                    annual reports. Also included is a nearly complete run of the club's yearbook,
                    which includes member lists, articles of incorporation and by-laws, lists of
                    speakers and lecture titles (after the 1940s), a history of the club and the
                    "house rules."</p>
