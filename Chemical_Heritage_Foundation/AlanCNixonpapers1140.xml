            <bioghist>
                <p>Alan C. Nixon (1909-2002) was a research chemist with Shell Development and
                    served as president of the American Chemical Society (ACS). In 1968, he founded
                    Project SEED, a program that offered economically disadvantaged students the
                    opportunity to work in chemistry settings. He was well known to readers of the
                    Vortex, the publication of the California section of the ACS, for which he wrote
                    a column, "Nick Nacks." Following retirement, he founded Calsec Consultants, a
                    Berkeley company made up of about 70 retired chemists, chemical engineers, and
                    other scientists that provided consulting services to the public. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of copies of articles written by Nixon. His column
                    "Employment" was published in the Vortex from 1965 to 1971. In 1971, the
                    subjects of Nixon's Vortex articles became more general, and they were published
                    under the title "Nick Nacks." There is some overlap between the two articles
                    in 1971. Many editions of "Nick Nacks" from 1971 to 1996 are present in this
                    collection in a pre-print format. Some of the pre-printed articles never
                    appeared in the Vortex. Also included in this collection is a bound set of
                    humorous letters exchanged among a group of friends and Nixon's curriculum
                    vitae.</p>
