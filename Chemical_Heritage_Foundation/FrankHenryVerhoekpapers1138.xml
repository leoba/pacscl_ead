            <bioghist>
                <p>Frank H. Verhoek, received his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in
                    1933. He was a professor in the Chemistry Department of the Ohio State
                    University and in 1960 became a vice-chairman of the department. The Chemical
                    Bond Approach (CBA) was one of the major revisions to teaching of high school
                    chemistry which emerged from the curriculum reform movement of the 1950's. The
                    CBA Project's goal was to develop a high school chemistry curriculum that
                    combined experimentation with theory.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection consists mainly of notebooks and course materials from Verhoek's
                    undergraduate and graduate studies, as well as materials related to the Chemical
                    Bond Approach. Verhoek's notebooks include his notes from courses in chemistry,
                    physics and mathematics at Harvard University (1925-1929) and the University of
                    Wisconsin (1929-1933). There are also lab record books and examination questions
                    from a general chemistry course at the University of Wisconsin and information
                    related to a memorial volume in 1972 for Farrington Daniels, a professor of
                    chemistry at the University of Wisconsin. The Chemical Bond Approach materials
                    include original drafts of two educational units Verhoek and others prepared for
                    the 1959 meeting of the CBA at Reed College, several CBA newsletters from 1961
                    and 1962, other printed materials from 1964 to 1965, a report titled "The
                    Content of Introductory College Chemistry" published by the Committee on
                    General Chemistry of the Advisory Council on College Chemistry from 1965, and a
                    small amount of correspondence. There are also two printed volumes on analytical
                    chemistry written in German and a ca. 1970 typewritten history of the Department
                    of Chemistry at the Ohio State University written by Earle R. Caby.</p>
