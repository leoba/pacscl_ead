            <bioghist>
                <p>In 1982, the Center for the History of Chemistry (CHOC) was launched as a pilot
                    project of the University of Pennsylvania and the American Chemical Society
                    (ACS). In 1987 CHOC was incorporated as a not-for-profit organization, now named
                    the National Foundation for the History of Chemistry, by joint action of the ACS
                    and AIChE, the Center's third sponsor. In 1992 the Chemical Heritage Foundation
                    (CHF) assumed its present name to better reflect the interdisciplinary nature of
                    the sciences and industries it serves and the widening public scope of its
                    activities.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of the Chemical Heritage Foundation's research files on
                    chemical corporations and industries, professional organizations and
                    associations, and individual chemists. Records include: annual reports, printed
                    histories, industry directories, and product listings and brochures from
                    chemical manufacturing and research companies (1953-1992); interviews,
                    biographical sketches, articles, and encyclopedia entries on notable chemists;
                    and printed brochures and annual reports from associations and societies of
                    professional chemists. The collection contains research materials from book
                    projects on Samuel Natelson, John Dee, Robert Burns Woodward, and Arnold
                    Beckman. These materials include: correspondence; photocopies of articles and
                    works by the subjects; bound volumes of Natelson's publications; transcripts and
                    audiotapes of interviews with Beckman; and photocopies of Dee's diaries. This
                    collection also includes a small selection of documents relating to the Chemical
                    Heritage Foundation's 1997-1999 board meetings and the Othmer Gold Medal.</p>
