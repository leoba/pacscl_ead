            <bioghist>
                <p>John E. Willard (1908-1996) was a professor of chemistry at the University of
                    Wisconsin (1937-1979) whose research included radiation chemistry,
                    photochemistry, the chemical effects of nuclear transformations, and the nature
                    and reactions of trapped intermediates. Early in his career (1935-1937) he was
                    an instructor at Haverford College.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>These papers illustrate Professor Willard's long association with the American
                    Chemical Society (ACS) and other national and international scientific bodies,
                    documenting various meetings, both national and international, in which he
                    participated or which he helped to organize. One group is concerned with the
                    organizational meeting of the Section on Nuclear Chemistry of the International
                    Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in New York in 1951; Professor
                    Willard was the secretary. Willard was also an officer for most of the post-war
                    period of the Division of Physical and Inorganic Chemistry of the ACS; thus one
                    group of papers represent records and correspondence of the Division. There are
                    also summaries of the research of Professor Willard's group at the University of
                    Wisconsin. [Photographs,] lists of attendees and programs of the Gordon Research
                    Conference on Nuclear (later Radiation) Chemistry from 1951 constitute another
                    group.</p>
