            <bioghist>
                <p>Chemical Education Material Study (CHEM Study) and the Chemical Bond Approach
                    (CBA) Project were two efforts begun in the late 1950s to develop new approaches
                    to teaching chemistry to secondary students. CHEM Study was established in 1959
                    on the basis of a recommendation by an ad hoc committee of the American Chemical
                    Society. CBA was first developed in 1959.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of materials from both the CHEM Study and the CBA
                    projects. The CHEM Study materials include: teaching guides, scripts, French
                    translations of scripts, and listings of CHEM Study filmstrips; copies of a
                    grant proposal to NSF; newsletters; articles on CHEM Study; exams; and documents
                    relating to lawsuits stemming from laboratory accidents. The CBA materials
                    include: drafts of teacher's guides and textbooks; newsletters and brochures;
                    exams; and a list of participating schools and teachers.</p>
