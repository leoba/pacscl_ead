            <bioghist>
                <p>Charles P. Smyth received his AB and AM from Princeton and his Ph.D. from
                    Harvard, where he studied under Theodore William Richards. He served as a First
                    Lieutenant in the Chemical Warfare Service in World War I. In 1920 he began
                    working as an instructor at Princeton. He made steady career progress there, and
                    by 1938 he was Professor of Chemistry. His principal research involved
                    properties of amalgams, refraction, dielectric constant and loss, dipole moment
                    and molecular structure, molecular rotation in solids, and microwave absorption
                    in liquids. </p>
