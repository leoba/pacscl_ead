            <bioghist>
                <p>The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society is Americaâ€™s first horticultural society
                    and was formed in 1827 as a not-for-profit membership organization. The
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society offers lectures and workshops, publishes the
                    magazine Green Scene, and hosts the yearly Philadelphia Flower Show. First held
                    in 1829, the Philadelphia Flower Show has grown to be the world's largest indoor
                    flower exhibition. Proceeds from the Philadelphia Flower Show support the
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's urban greening program, Philadelphia Green,
                    which supports the development and ongoing care of community gardens,
                    neighborhood parks and high-profile public green spaces in Philadelphia. The
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society is also home to the McLean Library, a
                    collection of over 15,000 books on gardening and plant care, botany, and urban
                    greening.</p>

                <p>This collection documents many aspects of the history of the Pennsylvania
                    Horticultural Society and the Philadelphia Flower Show. Administrative records
                    of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society in this collection include: printed
                    articles of incorporation, constitution, and bylaws; minutes, reports, and
                    correspondence of committees of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society,
                    including Finance, Executive, Awards, and Exhibits; and director's and
                    president's correspondence and files, primarily for Ernesta Drinker Ballard, J.
                    Liddon Pennock, Jr., and George R. Clark. The director's records consist
                    primarily of incoming and outgoing correspondence regarding exhibitions and
                    events, relationships with other organizations, board business, local
                    government/political issues (such as the society's opposition to Schuylkill
                    Expressway), and local horticultural resources, such as Morris Arboretum and
                    Fairmount Park, including Horticultural Hall. Other administrative records
                    include: correspondence regarding trusts; annual financial statements (1924-1945
                    and 1954-1962); and records related the allocation of funds from the Annual
                    Horticultural Advancement Fund. There is also documentation related to the
                    society's buildings, including leases, architectural drawings, and photographs.
                    The collection contains documentation of the society's events and programs, such
                    as the Philadelphia Flower Show, and includes materials related to the transfer
                    of the show from the auspices of the Philadelphia Flower Show, Inc. to the
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society in the late 1960s. There are also detailed
                    awards lists from the Flower Show from 1988 to 1994; documentation of the 175th
                    anniversary of the show in 2004; and artifacts and ephemera, such as awards,
                    plaques, ribbons, medals, tickets, membership cards, and printing plates for
                    images of medals and awards. Other events and programs documented include the
                    planning of the Governor's Gardens and the Azalea Garden in Fairmount Park; the
                    society's participation in the International Horticultural Congress; celebration
                    of the society's 125th, 150th, and 175th anniversaries; and information on the
                    society's activities for the Bicentennial, including the 10,000 Trees program,
                    the proposed Philaflora garden show, the "From Seed to Flower" exhibit and the
                    "How Long is Always" film project. There are transcripts of a series of
                    lectures in the 1920s and transcripts of radio programs from 1980. Philadelphia
                    Green materials include: early proposals for the project; correspondence,
                    minutes, annual reports, and budgets; and records on merging of the Neighborhood
                    Garden Association Garden Block program with Philadelphia Green. Printed and
                    publicity materials include a small number of copies of "Pennsylvania Gardens"
                    and "Green Scene," and clippings and press releases for events. The collection
                    includes some photographs, slides, contact sheets, and transparencies of the
                    Flower Show (exhibitors and awards ceremonies), clinics and demonstrations, the
                    library, staff and board members, member tours, Philadelphia Green activities,
                    and various public and private gardens, including the George and Mary Clark home
                    in Flourtown.</p>
