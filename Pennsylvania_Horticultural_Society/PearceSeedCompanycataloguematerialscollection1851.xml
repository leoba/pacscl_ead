            <bioghist>
                <p>Rex D. Pearce was a seedsman and nurseryman with operations in Merchantsville and
                    Moorestown, New Jersey. His company specialized in rare seeds, bulbs, and
                    plants. The nursery and seed company flourished between the 1920s and the
                    1960s.</p>

                <p>This collection consists of botanical illustrations, many produced for the Pearce
                    Seed Company seed catalogues. The illustrations are preserved in a variety of
                    stages of production, from pencil sketches and inked drawings to printed
                    versions. There is a series of over 100 illustrations of individual species
                    drawn by R.M. DonDero, accompanied by typescript or manuscript descriptions and
                    cultivation information. Other artists represented in the collection include
                    Elmer H. Kreps and Eleanor B. Acker, who created cover illustrations for the
                    Pearce Seed Company catalogs.</p>
