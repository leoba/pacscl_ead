            <bioghist>
                <p>The Neighborhood Garden Association of Philadelphia was founded in 1953 by Louise
                    Bush-Brown, an author of gardening books and the Director of the Pennsylvania
                    School of Horticulture in Ambler. After a trip to Europe, she got the idea of
                    planting window boxes in depressed areas of Philadelphia to improve conditions
                    in the inner-city neighborhoods and organized constructive garden projects for
                    adult and youth groups.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of materials related to the Neighborhood Garden Association
                    of Philadelphia. Items include: a copy of the by-laws; a list of board of
                    directors (1969); minutes (1971); correspondence of Louise Bush-Brown related to
                    NGA lectures and programs; reports on projects and histories of the NGA; several
                    drafts of "Flower That Touched a City's Heart," an article by Bush-Brown on
                    the NGA; a scrapbook (1955-1966); and photo albums. The collection includes many
                    slides documenting the association's projects, beginning in 1953. These projects
                    include the Garden Block program and Demonstration Gardens. Many of the slides
                    note the addresses of the gardens and the year.</p>
