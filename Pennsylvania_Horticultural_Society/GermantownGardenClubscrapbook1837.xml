            <bioghist>
                <p>The Germantown Garden Club was formed in 1932 by Natalie Kimber, Mary Wright, and
                    several other friends who had for a number of years been gardening together and
                    sharing information about plants and their cultivation. The group and its
                    various members took trips to collect specimens, held contests for arrangement
                    and plant specimens in advance of the annual Philadelphia Flower Show, engaged
                    in community gardening projects, planted victory gardens, and sponsored
                    lectures. In addition to entering the Flower Show as competitors, members of the
                    Germantown Garden Club served as hostesses at the event. The club was disbanded
                    sometime prior to 2000.</p>
