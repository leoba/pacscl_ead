            <bioghist>
                <p>The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society is Americaâ€™s first horticultural society
                    and was formed in 1827 as a not-for-profit membership organization. The McLean
                    Library, formed shortly after the founding of the Pennsylvania Horticultural
                    Society, currently holds over 15,000 volumes on gardening and plant care,
                    botany, and urban greening, and the archives of the Philadelphia Flower Show and
                    the society. The library also houses nearly 30,000 images of the Philadelphia
                    Flower Show, pre-World War II estate gardens of the Philadelphia area, and
                    garden and landscape images from around the world, 1930s-1960s. </p>
