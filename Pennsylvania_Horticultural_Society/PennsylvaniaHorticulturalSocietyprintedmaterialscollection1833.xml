            <bioghist>
                <p>The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society is Americaâ€™s first horticultural society
                    and was formed in 1827 as a not-for-profit membership organization. The
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society offers lectures and workshops, publishes the
                    magazine Green Scene, and hosts the yearly Philadelphia Flower Show. First held
                    in 1829, the Philadelphia Flower Show has grown to be the world's largest indoor
                    flower exhibition. Proceeds from the Philadelphia Flower Show support the
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's urban greening program, Philadelphia Green,
                    which supports the development and ongoing care of community gardens,
                    neighborhood parks and high-profile public green spaces in Philadelphia. The
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society is also home to the McLean Library, a
                    collection of over 15,000 books on gardening and plant care, botany, and urban
                    greening.</p>
