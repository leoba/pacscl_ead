            <bioghist>
                <p>The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society is Americaâ€™s first horticultural society
                    and was formed in 1827 as a not-for-profit membership organization. The
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society offers lectures and workshops, publishes the
                    magazine Green Scene, and hosts the yearly Philadelphia Flower Show. First held
                    in 1829, the Philadelphia Flower Show has grown to be the world's largest indoor
                    flower exhibition. Proceeds from the Philadelphia Flower Show support the
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's urban greening program, Philadelphia Green,
                    which supports the development and ongoing care of community gardens,
                    neighborhood parks and high-profile public green spaces in Philadelphia. The
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society is also home to the McLean Library, a
                    collection of over 15,000 books on gardening and plant care, botany, and urban
                    greening.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of scrapbooks on the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society and
                    its activities, including the Philadelphia Flower Show. The books primarily
                    consist of newspaper clippings, materials printed by the society, such as
                    programs, tickets, and announcements, and Flower Show entry forms. Some of the
                    books also include printed material and publicity for other horticultural
                    organizations, including the Massachusetts Horticultural Society, the
                    Horticultural Society of New York, and the Cleveland Flower Show. There are
                    scrapbooks covering the society and the Flower Show from 1884 to 1898, 1928 to
                    1933 and 1950 to 1968. There are also scrapbooks on particular topics, including
                    the 1927 Centennial Anniversary of the society, obituaries of nurserymen and
                    seedsmen primarily from the 1920s, Philadelphia Green from 1978 to 1985, and the
                    Junior Flower Show from 1975 to 1983. Several of the later scrapbooks contain a
                    small number of photographs.</p>
