            <bioghist>
                <p>Mrs. William Redwood Wright was born Letitia Ellicott Carpenter on April 7, 1861.
                    She was the daughter of George Washington Carpenter and Mary Rodman Fisher, and
                    was a direct descendent of James Logan, who left England in the late seventeenth
                    century to settle in the colonies as William Pennâ€™s Chief Secretary and
                    Counselor. She was an expert on wildflowers, and was involved in several
                    horticultural and conservation organizations, including the First Garden Club of
                    Philadelphia, of which she was a charter member. She is noted for her careful
                    study and restoration of the Stenton Garden, originally planted by James Logan.
                    Her monograph, "Colonial Garden at Stenton described in Old Letters," was
                    published by the Site and Relic Society of Germantown in 1915.</p>
