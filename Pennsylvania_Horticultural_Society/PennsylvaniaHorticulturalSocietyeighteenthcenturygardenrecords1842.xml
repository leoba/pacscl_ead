            <bioghist>
                <p>The Pennsylvania Horticultural Society planted and maintained a garden at their
                    headquarters at 325 Walnut Street in Philadelphia. This garden was in
                    Independence National Historical Park, and was a recreation of an English-style
                    garden, with paved walkways, parterres full of flowers, a small orchard, and an
                    area for vegetables. The plants in the garden were a mixture of native species
                    and those brought to the colonies from Europe. The garden was dedicated in 1966
                    by Lady Bird Johnson.</p>

                <p>This collection documents the garden that the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society
                    planted and maintained in Independence National Historical Park. Materials
                    include: correspondence about planning and planting of the garden, maintenance,
                    and publicity; lists of plants suitable for eighteenth century gardens; garden
                    plans; estimates and invoices from landscapers and nurseries; work schedules and
                    lists of volunteers; and a small number of photographs. The collection also
                    includes a copy of a Time-Life guide to annuals, in which an image of the garden
                    appears.</p>
