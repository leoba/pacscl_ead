            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Flower Show, currently the world's largest indoor flower
                    exhibition, was first held in 1829 in Masonic Hall on Chestnut Street. From 1927
                    until the mid 1960s, management of the Flower Show was under the auspices of
                    Philadelphia Flower Show, Inc., a professional group of nurserymen and growers.
                    In 1964, Philadelphia Flower Show, Inc., because of difficulties locating an
                    exhibition space, decided to halt production of the show for two years. The
                    Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, under the direction of Ernesta D. Ballard,
                    feeling that yearly continuity of the show was necessary, hosted the show in the
                    23rd Street Armory. In 1968, the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society became the
                    Flower Show's official producer.</p>
