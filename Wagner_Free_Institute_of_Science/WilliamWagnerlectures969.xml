            <bioghist>
                <p>William Wagner was a gentleman scientist and avid collector of natural history
                    specimens. After retiring from business as a merchant in 1840, he devoted
                    himself to science. Believing that education in the sciences should be available
                    to everyone, Wagner began offering free lectures on science at his home, Elm
                    Grove, in 1847. Finding that interest in these lectures was strong, in 1855
                    Wagner founded the Wagner Free Institute of Science and moved the lectures to
                    Spring Garden Hall. In 1859 construction began on a permanent home for his
                    collections and his educational program, which opened to the public in 1865.</p>

                    but also include lectures, for example, on education, agriculture and
                    aesthetics. Some notable lecture titles include "Two Lectures on the Theories
                    Respecting the Original Introduction of the Species," "Habits and Harmonies of
                    Birds," "Remarks on the Duration of Rewards and Punishment in a Future
