            <bioghist>
                <p>Paul Seel (1904-1982) was a prominent mineralogist and micromounter in
                    Pennsylvania, with training in crystallography and optical mineralogy. He was a
                    member of the Leidy Microscopical Society and the Philadelphia Mineralogical
                    Society, also serving as that group's president. In 1936, he married Hildegard
                    Marie Adelheid (1901-1987), who shared his interest in minerals. The Seels were
                    avid collectors, and upon Paul Seel's death a portion of the couple's collection
                    was donated to the Wagner Free Institute of Science. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The Paul and Hilde Seel papers are comprised of multiple accessions. The first
                    part (collection 90-025) includes naturalization papers and marriage certificate
                    for Paul and Hilde Seel, photographs, correspondence with Harry Trudell and
                    Edgar Wherry, Trudell/Clifford Frondel correspondence, pamphlets and articles
                    including "New and little-known corals of the Florida Formation" (1973) by
                    Norman E. Weisbord and a "Re-examination of Legrandite" (1963) by Paul E.
                    Desautels and Roy E. Clark, Jr. Other materials include a scrapbook (collection
                    92-012), which consists chiefly of photographs and memorabilia compiled by Paul
                    and Hilde Seel relating to the 21st Annual Convention of the Eastern Federation
                    of Mineralogical &amp; Lapidary Societies held in Lake Placid, NY, June 1971.
                    Accompanying materials include convention programs, stamps, one album sheet, and
                    a paper given by Paul Seel titled "Observations on Diamond Crystals" at the
                    20th Annual Convention of the International Diamond Association of America,
                    March 5, 1965. </p>
