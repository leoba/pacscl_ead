                <p>Incorporated by William Wagner in 1855, the Wagner Free Institute of Science is a
                    natural history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is
                    dedicated to providing free public education in the sciences. The Annual
                    Announcement provides information about the lectures and other offerings of the
                    Institute and was published every August from 1855-1927 and from 1959 to the
