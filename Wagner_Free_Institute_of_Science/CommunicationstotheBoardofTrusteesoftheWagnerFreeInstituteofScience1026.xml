            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated by William Wagner in 1855, the Wagner Free Institute is a natural
                    history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is dedicated to
                    providing free public education in the sciences. The Board of Trustees of the
                    Wagner Free Institute of Science was incorporated in 1855 with the object of
                    overseeing the financial, educational, and operational activities of the
                    Institute. Early board members included William Wagner, who was "President for
                    life," Robert Cornelius, D. Rodney King, Charles J. Stille, J. Vaughan Merrick,
                    Samuel Wagner, Jr., and Professor Henry Coppee. The Directors of the Wagner Free
                    Institute of Science submitted reports to the Trustees on the activities of the
                    museum, library, faculty, and real estate holdings of the Institute.</p>
