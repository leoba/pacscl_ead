            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated by William Wagner in 1855, the Wagner Free Institute is a natural
                    history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is dedicated to
                    providing free public education in the sciences. William Wagner originally
                    offered free lectures and classes in his home and at Spring Garden Hall. He
                    later constructed an Institute building, which opened to the public in 1865. The
                    Institute's current programs and services include adult and children's
                    programming offered onsite and at locations around Philadelphia, the Institute's
                    library and archival collections, and a permanent display of the museum's
                    specimen collections. Since 1891, the specimen collections have been displayed
                    according to Darwinian principles of evolution, the organizational scheme
                    selected by renowned biologist Joseph Leidy during his tenure as head of the
                    Institute's scientific and educational programs in the late 19th century. During
                    the time period covered by these records, the Director of the Wagner Free
                    Institute of Science oversaw the daily running of the Institute's educational,
                    library, and museum activities. The Director reported to the Board of Trustees,
                    and that body made decisions about the Institute's financial expenditures,
                    policies, and programs. Administrators during the time period covered by this
                    collection include: Thomas Lynch Montgomery, Actuary and Librarian, 1886-1903;
                    John Rothermel, Director, 1903-1924; Carl Boyer, Curator, 1924-1928, and
                    Director, 1928-1945; Robert Chambers, Director, 1945-1980; and John Graham,
                    Director, 1980-1988. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection is a complete run of director's reports from 1903 to 1988. In the
                    earlier years of this period, these were submitted monthly, excluding summer
                    months, and in later years they were submitted roughly quarterly. These reports
                    detail the status of the real estate properties held by the Institute and the
                    estate of William Wagner. They also report on the status of the Institute's
                    other financial interests, lectures and programs, building maintenance, and
                    publicity activities.</p>
