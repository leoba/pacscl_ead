            <bioghist>
                <p>Joseph Leidy (1823-1891) was one of the preeminent figures in the development of
                    American science in the nineteenth century. He was a physician, naturalist,
                    anatomist, and scientific illustrator. Following William Wagner's death in 1885,
                    Leidy assumed the role of President of the Faculty of the Wagner Free Institute
                    of Science, with special direction of the Biology Department. Leidy was Chairman
                    of the Board of Curators at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, and
                    is a central figure in that institution's history. He also taught courses at the
                    University of Pennsylvania and at Swarthmore College.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of Joseph Leidy's original drawings created to
                    illustrate his scientific writings. The originals are done in graphite pencil,
                    ink, and watercolor on a variety of supports including small cards, onion skin,
                    and the backs of social invitations and announcements. Most drawings are
                    annotated and some carry a date. Included are many drawings from Leidy's
                    Fresh-water rhizopods of North America (United States Geological Survey, v. 12,
                    1879). Also included in the collection is a brief personal note from Leidy to
                    Joseph Willcox, dated 1890.</p>
