            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated by William Wagner in 1855, the Wagner Free Institute is a natural
                    history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is dedicated to
                    providing free public education in the sciences. William Wagner originally
                    offered free lectures and classes in his home and at Spring Garden Hall. He
                    later constructed an Institute building, which opened to the public in 1865. The
                    Institute's current programs and services include adult and children's
                    programming offered onsite and at locations around Philadelphia, the Institute's
                    library and archival collections, and a permanent display of the museum's
                    specimen collections. Since 1891, the specimen collections have been displayed
                    according to Darwinian principles of evolution, the organizational scheme
                    selected by renowned biologist Joseph Leidy during his tenure as head of the
                    Institute's scientific and educational programs in the late 19th century.</p>
