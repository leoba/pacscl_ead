            <bioghist>
                <p>William Wagner (1796-1885) was a philanthropist and naturalist. At the age of 16,
                    he was apprenticed to the financier Stephen Girard. In 1816 he was sent as an
                    assistant supercargo on a two-year trading voyage, during which he collected
                    many shell, plant, and fossil specimens. After leaving Girard's employ, he went
                    into business as a shipping merchant with Charles A. Snowden. This partnership
                    was dissolved in 1825, and Wagner continued as a merchant in his own firm. He
                    retired from business in 1840. In 1847, he began to deliver lectures on
                    scientific topics, and, finding that interest in these lectures was strong,
                    founded the Wagner Free Institute of Science in 1855.</p>
