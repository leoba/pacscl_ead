            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated by William Wagner in 1855, the Wagner Free Institute is a natural
                    history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is dedicated to
                    providing free public education in the sciences. William Wagner originally
                    offered free lectures and classes in his home and at Spring Garden Hall. He
                    later constructed an Institute building, which opened to the public in 1865.
                    Since 1891, the specimen collections have been displayed according to Darwinian
                    principles of evolution, the organizational scheme selected by renowned
                    biologist Joseph Leidy during his tenure as head of the Institute's scientific
                    and educational programs in the late 19th century.</p>
