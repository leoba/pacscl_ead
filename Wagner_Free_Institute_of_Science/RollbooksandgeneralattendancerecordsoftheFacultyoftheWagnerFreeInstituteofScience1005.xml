            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated by William Wagner in 1855, the Wagner Free Institute is a natural
                    history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is dedicated to
                    providing free public education in the sciences. William Wagner originally
                    offered free lectures and classes in his home and at Spring Garden Hall. He
                    later constructed an Institute building, which opened to the public in 1865. The
                    Institute's educational programming is offered onsite and at locations around
                    Philadelphia. </p>

                <p>This collection consists of 17 volumes of roll books for the lecture series at
                    the Wagner Free Institute of Science from 1893 to 1979. Thirteen volumes are
                    course-specific roll books, listing names of professors and students' names,
                    attendance, grades, and certificates received for each course. The other four
                    volumes contain yearly statistics of the number of lectures given, number of
                    attendees, and number of certificates awarded. In these summary volumes, course
                    titles and names of students are sometimes pasted in.</p>
