            <bioghist>
                <p>William Wagner (1796-1885) was a philanthropist and naturalist. At the age of 16,
                    he was apprenticed to the financier Stephen Girard. In 1816 he was sent as an
                    assistant supercargo on a two-year trading voyage, during which he collected
                    many shell, plant, and fossil specimens. After leaving Girard's employ, he went
                    into business as a shipping merchant with Charles A. Snowden. This partnership
                    was dissolved in 1825, and Wagner continued as a merchant in his own firm. He
                    retired from business in 1840. In 1847, he began to deliver lectures on
                    scientific topics, and, finding that interest in these lectures was strong,
                    founded the Wagner Free Institute of Science in 1855.</p>

                <p>This small volume is a printed catalog from the bookselling firm of J.-B.
                    Balliere listing natural history books from France and other countries. The
                    catalog is entitled Livres d'Histoire Naturelle Francais et Etrangers. Histoire
                    Naturelle Generale. In the last pages, William Wagner compiled a short list of
                    publications, and there are two additional loose items included with the volume.
                    The loose lists include information on fossil sites in Germany, Sicily, Italy,
                    France, and Poland; contacts in various European cities; and indications of
                    boxes of specimens sent to and from various contacts in Germany, St. Petersburg,
                    and other areas in 1837 and 1838, as well as notations of meetings with some
                    contacts. Much of the material is undated; the printed item is dated 1840 while
                    one of the loose items carries dates of 1837 and 1838. The printed item is in
                    French while Wagner's notes are in English.</p>

                <p>Related material may be found in the following collections: Wagner Free Institute
                    of Science: the Robert Chambers collection (90-015) (Box 5, folder 61) contains
                    a series of letters of introduction given to William Wagner for his honeymoon
                    trip to Europe in 1841-1842. These letters may relate to one of Wagner's
                    handwritten lists in this collection. These also seem to correspond to the
                    William Wagner European travel journal (89-005).</p>
