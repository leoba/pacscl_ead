            <bioghist>
                <p>Emma Garman (d. 1943) was a science teacher at Wagner Junior HIgh School in
                    Philadelphia. She received her M.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, and her
                    Ph.D. from Temple University.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of numerous letters and documents pulled from various
                    files by Emma Garman for her 1941 dissertation on the history of the Wagner Free
                    Institute of Science. The letters have been arranged as Garman organized them.
                    Many of the letters deal with Wagner's commercial affairs, and seem to be
                    typical examples of his business correspondence. The collection also includes
                    materials relating to William Wagner's beginnings with Stephen Girard, as well
                    as a few records of the Institute. There are a handful of letters dating from
                    1918 to 1921 from the Philadelphia Mineralogical Society and the City History
                    Society of Philadelphia to John Rothermel, the Director of the Wagner from
                    1903-1924.</p>
