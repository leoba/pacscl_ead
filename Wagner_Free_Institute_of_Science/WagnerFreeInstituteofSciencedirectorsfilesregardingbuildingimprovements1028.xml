            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated by William Wagner in 1855, the Wagner Free Institute is a natural
                    history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is dedicated to
                    providing free public education in the sciences. In 1892, the Free Library of
                    Philadelphia opened its first branch at the Institute. It was determined that
                    more space was needed to house the library branch, and in 1901, a new wing of
                    the Institute building was opened for that purpose. In 1962 the branch was moved
                    from the Wagner to Cecil B. Moore Avenue.</p>
