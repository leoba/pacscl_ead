            <bioghist>
                <p>Richard Brodhead Westbrook (1820-1899) was a well-known lawyer and Presbyterian
                    minister. He was a Trustee of the Wagner Free Institute of Science from 1884
                    until his death in 1899. He was appointed Treasurer in 1885. He received an
                    honorary degree from the Institute in the same year. In his will, he established
                    an endowment for the Richard B. Westbrook Free Lectureship, which began in 1912.
