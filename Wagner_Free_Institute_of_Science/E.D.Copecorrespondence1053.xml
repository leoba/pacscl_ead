            <bioghist>
                <p>Edward Drinker Cope (1840-1897) was one of the leading paleontologists of the
                    19th century. He was a protege of Joseph Leidy, and avid collector of fossils.
                    He is perhaps most famous for his intense competition with O.C. Marsh over the
                    acquisition and intellectual credit for the discovery of dinosaur fossils.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection contains letters chiefly to William Wagner from Cope regarding
                    the collection of fishes and fossils made in North Carolina and Tennessee and
                    sent to the Wagner Free Institute of Science between April and November of 1869.
                    The collection also includes a letter to Joseph Willcox from Cope concerning
                    organization of the Institute, May 12, 1885, and a letter to Cope from F.S.
                    Holmes concerning an offer to sell his collection of fossils, June 1869.</p>
