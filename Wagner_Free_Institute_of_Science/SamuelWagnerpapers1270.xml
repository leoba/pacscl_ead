            <bioghist>
                <p>Samuel Wagner (1842-1937), nephew of William Wagner, assumed the presidency of
                    the Wagner Free Institute of Science upon his uncle's death in 1885 and served
                    in that role until 1921. From 1921 to 1937 he was President Emeritus of the
                    Institute. Wagner was also a Trustee of the Free Library of Philadelphia and one
                    of the founders of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>
