            <bioghist>
                <p>Incorporated by William Wagner in 1855, the Wagner Free Institute is a natural
                    history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is dedicated to
                    providing free public education in the sciences. William Wagner originally
                    offered free lectures and classes in his home and at Spring Garden Hall. He
                    later constructed an Institute building, which opened to the public in 1865. The
                    Institute's educational programming is offered onsite and at locations around
                    Philadelphia. </p>

                <p>This collection consists mainly of rough and final copies of the minutes of the
                    meetings of the Faculty of the Wagner Free Institute of Science for the years
                    1885-1886, 1903, and 1906-1911. The minutes during this period were submitted by
                    the Secretary of the Faculty (for most of this period, Samuel Tobias Wagner) to
                    the Director, to be presented to the Board of Trustees. The collection also
                    includes correspondence concerning lectures, course lists, and the awarding of
                    certificates to students.</p>
