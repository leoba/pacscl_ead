            <bioghist>
                <p>William Wagner (1796-1885) was a philanthropist and naturalist. At the age of 16,
                    he was apprenticed to the financier Stephen Girard. In 1816 he was sent as an
                    assistant supercargo on a two-year trading voyage, during which he collected
                    many shell, plant, and fossil specimens. After leaving Girard's employ, he went
                    into business as a shipping merchant with Charles A. Snowden. This partnership
                    was dissolved in 1825, and Wagner continued as a merchant in his own firm. He
                    retired from business in 1840. In 1847, he began to deliver lectures on
                    scientific topics, and, finding that interest in these lectures was strong,
                    founded the Wagner Free Institute of Science in 1855.</p>

                <p>This collection chiefly concerns an 1847 memorial to the Pennsylvania State
                    Senate and the House of Representatives. There is correspondence relating to the
                    proposed incorporation of Penn Township into the City of Philadelphia lands, and
                    a copy of the memorial that was signed by property owners in the township. The
                    collection also includes an 1834 certificate recording William Wagner's life
                    membership in the Franklin Institute, as well as two proof sheets of shell
                    illustrations and other letters, one of which is in Italian.</p>
