                    history museum and educational institution in Philadelphia that is dedicated to
                    providing free public education in the sciences. The Board of Trustees of the
                    Wagner Free Institute of Science was incorporated in 1855 with the object of

                    Institute. Early board members included William Wagner, who was "President for
                    life," Robert Cornelius, D. Rodney King, Charles J. Stille, J. Vaughan Merrick,
                    Samuel Wagner, Jr., and Professor Henry Coppee. </p>
