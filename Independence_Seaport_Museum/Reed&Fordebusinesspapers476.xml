                <p>French Spoliation Claims, demands made upon the U.S. government by American
                    merchants for shipping losses incurred at the hands of the French between 1793
                    and 1800. The American merchant vessels were sunk by the French, after the U.S.
                    had been charged by France with violating the terms of a commercial treaty
                    concluded between the two countries in 1778, during the American Revolution. The
                    spoliation claims were settled when the U.S. government effectuated the
                    Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and, in addition, assumed the claims of the American
                    merchants against the French to the amount of $3,750,000. Between 1800 and 1850,
                    approximately 50 legislative bills to reimburse the claimants or their
                    descendants came before Congress. Appropriations were voted on two occasions but
                    were vetoed by Presidents James Polk and Franklin Pierce. Finally, in 1885, the
                    claims were adjudicated and the descendants of the original claimants were
                    awarded $4.8 million. John Reed and Standish Forde were Philadelphia merchants
                    who traded directly to numerous European ports in Spain, France, Holland,
                    Portugal, and foreign West Indies.</p>
