            <bioghist>
                <p>Michael Mally was a staff photographer at the Philadelphia Inquirer. He had
                    previously worked at the Los Angeles Times, and his photographs have appeared in
                    Reader's Digest, Forbes, and numerous other publications. He followed the Navy
                    Yard story since his arrival in Philadelphia and his photographs were used to
                    illustrate Steve Twomey's 1986 Pulitzer Prize winning account in the Inquirer of
                    aircraft carriers at the Yard.</p>
