            <bioghist>
                <p>Wilmington Whaling Company was organized pn November 23, 1833. In 1835 the
                    company purchased the whaleship Ceres in New Bedford, and she became the pioneer
                    of the fleet. The Ceres, sailed in April, 1835 and was absent two and a half
                    years. Ceres (second voyage) sailed December 1, 1837, and absent forty months
                    with profitable results. The Ceres made another unprofitable voyage afterwards.
                    The whaling industry then declined, and the company sold its property in 1846
                    and went out of existence. Bernard Bradley was a teacher of mathematics at
                    Riley's College. He made the voyage on the Ceres for his health.</p>

                <p>Journal of Bernard Bradley, Wilmington Whaling Co., kept during his voyage aboard
                    the Ceres in 1841-1843. Bradley describes life on board, stops in ports for
                    provisioning, and the taking of whales. Later passages appear to be in another
                    hand, possibly that of William Eakins. Some pages at the end of the volume were
                    used as a writing exercise book.</p>
