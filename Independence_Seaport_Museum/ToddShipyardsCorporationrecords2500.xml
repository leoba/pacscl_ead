            <bioghist>
                <p>Todd Pacific Shipyards Corporation was founded in 1916 as the William H. Todd
                    Corporation through the merger of Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Company of Erie
                    Basin, Brooklyn, New York, the Tietjen &amp; Long Dry Dock Company of Hoboken,
                    New Jersey, and the Seattle Construction &amp; Dry Dock Company. The Seattle
                    shipyard could trace its history back to 1882, when Robert Moran opened a marine
                    repair shop at Yesler's Wharf. This shop became the Moran Brothers Shipyard in
                    1906 and the Seattle Construction &amp; Dry Dock Company at the end of 1911. The
                    tanker Fort Caspar was built in 1945 by Sun Shipbuilding for the US Maritime
                    Commission. In 1962, the ship was rebuilt as a self-unloader by Todd Shipyards
                    Corp. of Hoboken. The rebuilt vessel was renamed Inger. It was owned by Reynolds
                    Metals Co. of Corpus Christi, TX. The ship was scrapped in 1995.</p>

                    States flag. 13 photos of Inger during and after her conversion.</p>
