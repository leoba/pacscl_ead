            <bioghist>
                <p>American International Shipbuilding Corporation was established in 1916 on Hog
                    Island, at the downstream limit of the City of Philadelphia. It was designed to
                    be an assembly facility, with up to 80% of each hull being prefabricated
                    elsewhere. It occupied over 900 acres and had 50 building ways. After the war,
                    it was closed and liquidated, the Corps of Engineers filled in the creek that
                    made Hog Island an island and in 1925 it became an Air Force facility. It is now
                    occupied by Philadelphia International Airport and you can no longer see any
                    trace of the yard from the air.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of 8 x 10 original black and white photographs and some
                    reproduction photographs and 8 x 10 negatives. The images depict the operations
                    at shops of the A.I.C., in 1917 and 1918. A few of the photographs are undated,
                    but appear to come from the same time period. John L. Mahoney was the
                    photographer.</p>
