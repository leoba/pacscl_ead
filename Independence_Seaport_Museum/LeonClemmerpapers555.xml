            <bioghist>
                <p>Leon Clemmer attended Northeast Manual Training, and then Hahnemann Medical
                    College, a homeopathic teaching hospital in Philadelphia. After completing his
                    internship, Dr. Leon Clemmer enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 28. In
                    addition to his talents as a physician, Dr. Clemmer spoke German, a talent that
                    would prove a valuable asset in his tour of duty on USS Leonidas, in translating
                    German communications. After short assignments on USS Hannibal and USS
                    Tallahassee, Dr. Clemmer was assigned to Leonidas, and would remain with that
                    ship for the duration of the war. Leon Clemmer's son, Leon Clemmer, was a ship's
                    carpenter during World War II, and went on to become an architect. He was also
                    an historian and researched the sub chaser.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of journals, photographs, negatives, and other miscellaneous
                    papers of Leon Clemmer (father) (1917-1919). Journals describe Clemmers'
                    experiences with the flotilla of sub chasers that sailed from Bermuda to Corfu
                    in 1918. Photos include images of subchasers (SC134 and SC165) and crew, photos
                    of Clemmer; and negatives of the ships and their surroundings during the WWI
                    mission. Other papers include: commissions and awards and honors of Leon
                    Clemmer, 1916-1923i; newspaper clippings about Sub Chasers; a map of Corfu; a
                    Yugoslavian broadside announcing the arrival of Mr. Nelson from the US, and a
                    concert program. Research materials on Sub Chasers compiled by Leon Clemmer
                    (son) include photocopies of photographs from the US Navy Department's records;
                    newspaper and magazine articles about sub chasers; [plans for US 110ft sub
                    chaser from WWI--haven't located yet]; an instruction manual for the machinery
                    plant of a WWI sub chaser; printed volumes; and correspondence related to
                    Clemmer's research of the sub chaser. </p>
