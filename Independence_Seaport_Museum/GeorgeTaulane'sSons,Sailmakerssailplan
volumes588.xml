            <bioghist>
                <p>George Taulane (1833-1899) was a sailmaker. He bought the sail making business,
                    located at Delaware Ave. and Spruce Street, after his former employer died in
                    1854. When he died in 1899, his sons Lewis Baptiste and Edward G. Taulane took
                    over the business and changed its name to George Taulane's Sons Manufactures.
                    Around 1910 the business moved to Front and Delancey Streets and then sometime
                    later it moved again to its final location at 324 South Front Street. Edward
                    Taulane died in 1948, at which time the business was sold to another firm.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>Three large volumes of plans for sails made by the Taulane sail loft. The volumes
                    contain pencil and blueprint drafts and plans of sails as well as reference and
                    field notes, sketches, and clippings from publications. Many pages show the
                    prick marks of dividers used to transfer dimensions from a scale ruler. The
                    drafts are at a scale of one inch to ten feet. Included are plans for 2- and
                    3-masted schooners, brigs, and barques. The volumes have been indexed and most
                    of the plans have been at least tentatively identified. The collection also
                    includes a small scale ruler.</p>
