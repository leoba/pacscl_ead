            <bioghist>
                <p>Fulmer Warner (1878-1972) was a Private in the United States Marine Corps
                    (enlisted in 1897) who saw action in the Philippine Insurrection and in China
                    during the Boxer Rebellion. His last posting was in Puerto Rico. He was
                    discharged in 1903, after which he returned to Berks County, Pennsylvania. Later
                    he moved to California, where he died at the age of 94. Frank R. Brown (d. 1981)
                    was a radio and television journalist, director and actor. He served in the Air
                    Force as a Staff Sergeant during World War II (possibly a friend of Fulmer
                    Warner). </p>
