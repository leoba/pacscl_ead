            <bioghist>
                <p>Etienne Dutilh, a French merchant, emigrated to Philadelphia in 1783 and
                    established several commercial firms including E. Dutilh &amp; Company,
                    1783-1789; Dutilh &amp; Wachsmuth, with John Godfried Wachsmuth, 1790-1797; and
                    Dutilh, Soullier &amp; Company, with John Soullier, 1793-circa 1797. These firms
                    were largely engaged in the West Indies and northern European trade, with sugar,
                    coffee, cocoa, and logwood being the major commodities mentioned. Dutilh died in
                    1810, Wachsmuth died c. 1826.</p>

                <p>This collection is split into two subgroups: the business paper of Stephen Dutilh
                    and the business papers of the firm Dutilh &amp; Wachsmuth. The business papers
                    of Stephen Dutilh include: bills and receipts; account statements; the account
                    book of the brig Hetty; an insurance claim by the owners of the brig Betsy, and
                    an index of Dutilh's accounts. This subgroup also includes four bound volumes:
                    Dutilh's address book (written in French and alphabetized by city) entitled
                    "Livre de la Correspondence Generale," and account books for the years
                    1783-1788 (in French), 1792-1795, and 1795-1809. The papers of Dutilh &amp;
                    Wachsmuth consist of correspondence, bills of lading, invoices, orders, and
                    account statements. This subgroup also includes a blank power-of-attorney, a map
                    [c. 1764] entitled "A New Map or Chart in Mercators Projection of the Western
                    or Atlantic Ocean with part of Europe Africa and America," a promissory note,
                    and a check on the Bank of the United States. </p>
