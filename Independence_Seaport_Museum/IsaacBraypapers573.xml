                <p>Isaac Matthews Bray (1840-1896) was the captain of the Mary L. Cushing which was
                    built at Newburyport by John E. Currier. The 220 foot long barque, was named
                    after the wife of John Cushing, who had commissioned the vessel. The Mary L.
                    Cushing was employed in general freighting from the US to Japan and India. It
                    was sold in 1895 and was lost in the Pacific Ocean in 1905. </p>
