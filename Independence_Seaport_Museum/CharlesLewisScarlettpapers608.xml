            <bioghist>
                <p>As a teen Charles Lewis von Scharlach (d. 1943) ran away to sea to avoid being
                    trained as a doctor. He joined an Erikson sailing ship as an apprentice, sailed
                    to Australia and eventually jumped ship. He worked as a cowboy in Australia and
                    New Zealand for the next four years and returned to England at the age of 20. He
                    then joined the Royal Navy and was attached the Asiatic station. He served
                    aboard the HMS Algerine and the HMS Alacrity, during the Russo-Japanese war.
                    During WWI, Scharlach served in naval intelligence. Around the time of the war,
                    he changed his family name to Scarlett to avoid prejudice about the Germanic
                    name. After the war he returned to England.</p>
