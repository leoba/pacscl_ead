            <bioghist>
                <p>The Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company was incorporated in May 23, 1916, as a
                    tanker-building subsidiary of the Sun Oil Company. Soon after its founding it
                    began building ships for other companies. During World War II, the National
                    Defense Program helped make the Sun shipyard one of the world's biggest
                    producers of oil tankers. The company launched its final ship in 1980. John
                    Orner, Sr. (1905-1983), was a Sun Ship machinist. Orner worked for Sun from
                    circa 1931-1970.</p>
