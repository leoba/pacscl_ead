                <p>The Atlantic and Caribbean Steam Navigation Company, better known as the Red D
                    Line was the main transportation link between the United States and Venezuela
                    for 100 years. The company took its trade name from the red D on its white flag,
                    which stood for (John) Dallett, a Philadelphia merchant who went to Venezuela in
                    1823 soon after the country gained its independence from Spain. There he went
                    into business with the influential merchant John Boulton. Dallett returned to
                    Philadelphia and set up a business shipping cargoes to Boulton, and in 1838
                    began chartering sailing vessels to carry his merchandise. The company built an
                    excellent relationship with the Venezuelan government and business community,
                    but eventually decided to get out of the shipping business when the 1936
                    Merchant Marine Act terminated the system of mail contracts under which shipping
                    companies had been subsidized. The company was sold to the Grace Line in 1937,
                    which then merged the Venezuelan operations into Grace's overall service to
                    South America. http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/redd.htm -- more detail
