            <bioghist>
                <p>Isaac Hull (1773-1843), was a Commodore in the United States Navy. He was
                    commissioned a Lieutenant in the newly formed United States Navy in March 1798
                    and distinguished himself during the next two years while serving on board the
                    frigate Constitution in the Quasi-War with France. He commanded the Constitution
                    ("Old Ironsides") during the battle with HMS Guerriere in the War of 1812.
                    Thomas J. Chew was commissioned Purser on April 25, 1812. Chew was Purser aboard
                    the Constitution during the battle with the HMS Guerriere. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of a November 14, 1812 letter from Isaac Hull in New
                    York to Thomas J. Chew, discussing getting a portrait made (probably by Gilbert
                    Stuart), taking up a subscription on behalf of a man who lost his leg, and
                    requesting Chew to make out his accounts up to the 9th of September when he
                    (Hull) assumed command of the Navy Yard in Boston. The battle between the
                    Constitution and the Guerriere is discussed in the letter in the context of
                    sketches rendered in preparation for the portrait.</p>
