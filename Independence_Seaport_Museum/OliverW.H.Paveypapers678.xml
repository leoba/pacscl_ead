            <bioghist>
                <p>Oliver Wendell Holmes Pavey (1885-1972) enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1900 and was
                    discharged in 1906. He served aboard the cruiser Olympia as a First Class
                    Apprentice and later as Coxswain. He met and married his wife Minnie in 1912.
                    After he left the Navy, he was a farmer for a brief period and then an engineer
                    for the Central Vermont Railroad until his retirement. Minnie Pavey died in
                    1977.</p>
