            <bioghist>
                <p>Labor on the Delaware: The Longshoremen Experience was originally a documentary
                    film project in the early 1980s sponsored by the Philadelphia Maritime Museum
                    with the cooperation of the International Longshoremen's Association Local 1291,
                    Southwark House, and Temple University. The project received a grant from the
                    Public Committee for the Humanities in Pennsylvania. The project director was Ed
                    Kirlin. The project's aim was to document the history and experiences of
                    Longshoremen on the Delaware over the previous 80 years. The project staff taped
                    interviews with active and retired Longshoremen, union, and port officials.</p>
