                <p>The Pennsylvania Railroad was founded in 1846. Commonly referred to as the
                    "Pennsy," the Pennsylvania Railroad was headquartered in Philadelphia. The PRR
                    was the largest railroad by traffic and revenue in the U.S. throughout its 20th
                    century existence and was at one time the largest publicly traded corporation in
                    the world. At its peak, it controlled about 10,000 miles of rail line.</p>
