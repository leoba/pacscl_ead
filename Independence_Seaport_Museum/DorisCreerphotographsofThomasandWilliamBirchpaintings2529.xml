            <bioghist>
                <p>Doris Jean Creer wrote a Master's thesis titled "Thomas Birch: A Study of the
                    Condition of Painting and the Artist's Position in Federal America" (1958) for
                    the University of Delaware. Thomas Birch was a marine, landscape, portrait, and
                    miniature painter. He came to the United States from England with his father in
                    1794 and settled in Philadelphia. He studied under his father, William Russell
                    Birch, the noted enamelist and miniature painter. During the period 1799 to 1800
                    he worked with his father as William Birch &amp; Son designing, engraving, and
                    publishing views of Philadelphia. Around 1806, Thomas Birch began painting
                    portraits, in both oil and watercolor, as well as marine subjects. He became
                    especially noted for his ship portraits, seascapes, and winter scenes, as well
                    as paintings of naval battles of the War of 1812. Although his primary residence
                    was in Philadelphia, Birch also painted in New Jersey, visiting Bordentown
                    several times and painting views at Point Breeze, the Delaware River estate of
                    the exiled Joseph Bonaparte, former king of Naples and Spain.</p>
