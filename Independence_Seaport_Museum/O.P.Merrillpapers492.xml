            <bioghist>
                <p>Owen P. Merrill (1909-1989) was a noted yacht designer, yachtsman, and sailmaker.
                    As a young man, Merrill worked for Olin Stephens at Sparkman &amp; Stephens in
                    Scarsdale New York. In 1931, he was a member of the crew aboard Dorade which won
                    the Transltlantic Race and the Fastnet race. He also worked for the H. B. Nevins
                    yard in City Island, New York. Initially a chief bosun in the U.S. Coast Guard
                    Temporary Reserve, he skippered Edlu in the "off-shore yacht patrol" in the
                    early part of World War II. Later, he joined the Naval Reserve and commanded a
                    110' wooden subchaser. Following that assignment, he served as navigator aboard
                    an LSD and Fleet Tanker, seeing action at Luzon's Leyte Gulf and Lingayen Gulf,
                    as well as Okinawa. After the war, he worked in Philadelphia for Thomas Bowes,
                    designing small steel commercial vessels. In 1952, he went into the sailmaking
                    business in Delanco, New Jersey , which he continued into his late 60s.</p>
