            <bioghist>
                <p>Edward F.R. Wood, Jr. (1921-2000) was a vice president in the trust department of
                    PNC Bank and an author of histories of sailing and shipbuilding in Mattapoisett,
                    Massachusetts. He spent summers in Mattapoisett from the time he was a child,
                    and was an avid sailor. His books include Sailing Days at Mattapoisett and Old
                    Mattapoisett. In 2004 he co-authored The Ports of Old Rochester: Shipbuilding at
                    Mattapoisett and Marion with Judith Lund. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection of Edward F. R. Wood, Jr. papers includes scrapbooks,
                    photographs, research materials, and ephemera. The scrapbooks, consisting
                    primarily of clippings of newspaper stories and illustrations, are on a variety
                    of nautical topics, such as the Merchant Marines, yachting, maritime disasters,
                    and steamers. Photographs, negatives, postcards, and ephemera document several
                    New England coastal steamer lines, with a small amount of material related to
                    steamer lines operating out of other East Coast ports. There is an index file of
                    steamships, with some notes about owners, gross tonnage, and references to
                    articles on the ships. The collection also includes microfilm of holdings in the
                    National Archives related to small craft in use during the Civil War; a 1856
                    bill of lading from the Swiftsure Line; and a reproduction of a photograph of
                    Smith and Windmill Islands in the Delaware River. </p>
