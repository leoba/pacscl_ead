            <bioghist>
                <p>The Schuylkill Navy of Philadelphia is the oldest amateur athletic governing body
                    in the United States. It was founded in 1858 with nine clubs and approximately
                    300 members. . The member clubs of the Navy are all located on the Schuylkill
                    River where it flows through Fairmount Park in Philadelphia, with most of the
                    clubs being located on the historic Boathouse Row. Clubs represented at the
                    founding of the society in October 1858 included America, Camilla, Chebucto,
                    Falcon, Independent, Keystone, Neptune, Pennsylvania, and University. Later that
                    month Nautilus and Quaker City joined. Half of the clubs lapsed during the Civil
                    War. Current member clubs include Fairmount Rowing Association, Crescent Boat
                    Club, Bachelors Barge Club, University Barge Club, Malta Boat Club, Vesper Boat
                    Club, College Boat Club, Penn Athletic Club Rowing Association (Penn AC), Undine
                    Barge Club, Philadelphia Girls' Rowing Club (PGRC), Gillin Boat Club and St.
                    Joseph's University and St. Joseph's Prep. At least 23 other clubs have belonged
                    to the Navy at various times. By charter, "its object is to secure united
                    action among the several Clubs and to promote amateurism on the Schuylkill
                    River." Each club sends a delegate to the monthly meetings and the clubs elect
                    the officers of the Schuylkill Navy at the January meeting. The Schuylkill Navy
                    and its member clubs still host many races. In 1953, the Navy convinced the Dad
                    Vail Rowing Association to move its regatta to Philadelphia. It has remained
                    since. The Dad Vail is probably the largest collegiate regatta held and usually
                    signifies the end of the spring rowing season for most collegiate teams. Other
                    major regattas held each year include the Thomas Eakins Head of the Schuylkill
                    Regatta (sponsored by the University Barge Club) and the Frostbite Regatta. The
                    Navy also sponsors other athletic endeavors including a basketball league and an
                    annual cross country race. The latter has been held since 1899, with a few
                    interruptions during World War II.</p>
