                <p>USS Periwinkle (1864) was a steamer procured by the Union Navy during the final
                    months of the American Civil War. She served the Union Navyâ€™s struggle against
                    the Confederate States of America as a patrol gunship. USS Standish was an
                    iron-hulled screw tug built at Boston in 1864, completed too late for service in
                    the American Civil War. After completing her trials in January 1866, the ship
                    was laid up at Norfolk until 1871 when she was placed in service at the Norfolk
                    Navy Yard. She was sold on 5 August 1921 to B. Wever &amp; Sons, Baltimore, Md.
                    Samuel Matthews Vauclain (1856 -1940) was a lifelong employee of the Baldwin
                    Locomotive Works Company. He was a locomotive manufacturer, inventor, salesman,
                    and international businessman. One of his many achievements was the invention of
                    the compound locomotive in 1889. His brother James L. Vauclain (1838 and 1874)
                    was 1st Assistant Engineer on the USS Periwinkle and the USS Standish. In 1861,
                    James L. Vauclain a mechanic for the Lafayette and Indianapolis Railroad,
                    patented a locomotive smokestack that saved fuel and increased power by means of
                    a moveable throat that could be controlled by the engineer, and by employing a
                    smaller stack from which ashes and dust would be thrown higher.</p>
