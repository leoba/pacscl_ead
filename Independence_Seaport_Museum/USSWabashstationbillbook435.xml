                <p>Manuscript volume, possibly a station bill book for the USS Wabash on seamanship,
                    dated 1856. The volume includes instructions for bending sails, mooring and
                    unmooring, reefing and hoisting, bringing the ship to anchor, manning fire
                    stations, what to do when there is a man overboard, and port routines. The
                    volume also includes blank sheets on which to list the officers and crew of the
                    ship and lists of crew stations.</p>
