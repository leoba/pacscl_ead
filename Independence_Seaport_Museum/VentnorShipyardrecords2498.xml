            <bioghist>
                <p>Ventnor Boat Works was founded by Mr. Adolph Apel in 1902. The company gained
                    fame as builders of custom speed boats. At the beginning of World War II,
                    Ventnor relocated to Atlantic City, New Jersey, enlarged its facilities and
                    switched from building racing and pleasure craft to producing war ships. Ventnor
                    was contracted to build 83' and 104' air-sea rescue boats for the Army as well
                    as 110' sub-chasers for the Navy. Because of their outstanding work throughout
                    the war years, Ventnor received the coveted Army-Navy "E" award in 1946.</p>
