            <bioghist>
                <p>The Health Officer was an official of Philadelphia's Board of Health who had
                    responsibility for tracking ships arriving in the port from US and foreign
                    ports, examining the accounts of inspectors of incoming vessels, enforcing
                    quarantines, recording diseases of an infectious nature, and reporting regularly
                    to the Board of Health. The Health Officer worked with other Board of Health
                    officials, including the Port Physician, the Lazaretto (or quarantine)
                    Physician, and the Quarantine Master. </p>
