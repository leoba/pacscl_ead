            <bioghist>
                <p>John Reed and Standish Forde were Philadelphia merchants. The firm helped to open
                    up trade between the United States and Spanish America, specifically in New
                    Orleans. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a small collection of manuscripts, dating from 1785 to 1801, apparently
                    related to the mercantile firm Reed and Forde. Materials include an index to an
                    account book (only one page of which is present); notes about accounts; and a
                    list of balances due. The list of balances due notes ships owned by Reed and
                    Forde that were captured by the French (the brig Molly and the schooner
                    Ulalia).</p>
