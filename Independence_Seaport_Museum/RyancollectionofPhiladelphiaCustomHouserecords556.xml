            <bioghist>
                <p>The United States Customs Service (1789-1927) processed paperwork for the import
                    and export of goods into and out of the country. Customs officials also assessed
                    and collected customs fees and penalties. Past functions of the Customs Service
                    included administration of navigation aids and lighthouses, and functions
                    relating to the protection of seamen, and to revenue cutters. In 1927 the
                    Customs Service became the Bureau of Customs.</p>
