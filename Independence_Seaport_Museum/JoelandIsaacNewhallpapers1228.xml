            <bioghist>
                <p>Joel (1779-1839) and Isaac Newhall (1782-1858) were partners in a mercantile
                    trade in Salem, Massachusetts. In 1816-1818 they subscribed to the Massachusetts
                    Steam Navigation Company. In the early 1830s, Isaac Newhall engaged in business
                    with a younger brother, George Newhall (1793-1869), proprietor of George Newhall
                    &amp; Company, Boston. By 1836, Isaac had moved to Macon, George, where he
                    arranged shipments of Southern cotton and other agricultural produce. In 1844,
                    Isaac Newhall was living in Lynn, MA. An 1852 letter from Edw. Newhall and Sons,
                    Cincinnati to George Newhall suggests that other relatives were also engaged in
                    the dry goods trade.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of miscellaneous documents related to the business affairs
                    of the Newhalls. Materials documenting the partnership of Joel and Isaac Newhall
                    include incoming letters; receipts; bills of lading; bank notes; accounts
                    recording sales, transfers, and goods sold at auction; and records of shipments
                    of goods between Salem, New York, Boston, ports in Maine, Southern states, and
                    the Caribbean. Other materials document the trade of Isaac Newhall from 1832 to
                    1853; these records include bills, correspondence, and a marine insurance
                    policy,. Finally, there are several personal papers, including engravings of
                    William Clifton and Benjamin Franklin, and a poem initialed "G.N.," 1830,
                    probably by George Newhall.</p>
