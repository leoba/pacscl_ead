            <bioghist>
                <p>The Hubert S. Johnson Boat and Motor Company was founded in 1912 by Hubert S.
                    Johnson (d. 1949), son of boat builder Morton Johnson (1859-1930). Hubert opened
                    his new boat yard next to his father's yard, and in the following years Hubertâ€™s
                    boats were delivered around the world, including one to the King of Greece.
                    Hubert died in 1949, and the company was carried on by his children until
                    1969.</p>
