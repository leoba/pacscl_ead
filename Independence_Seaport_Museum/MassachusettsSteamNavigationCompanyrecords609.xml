            <bioghist>
                <p>The Massachusetts Steam Navigation Company was formed in 1816 and formally
                    incorporated in 1817. The company financed the building of the steamboat
                    Massachusetts in 1816 by William Dodge in Philadelphia. The steamboat made its
                    appearance in Salem, Massachusetts, in June of 1817. The vessel was probably the
                    first coastal steamer in the area of Boston and the adjacent north and south
                    coasts. The Massachusetts apparently operated at a loss and was sold to Captain
                    Charles Vanderford in November of 1817 and then to Francis H. Story later in the
                    same month. It was wrecked off the coast of New Jersey on its way to Alabama in
                    December 1817. In 1818, William Dodge requested permission to recover remains
                    from the wreckage. It has been suggested, but not confirmed, that parts from the
                    first Massachusetts were used in the construction of a later vessel of the same
                    name. Joel and Isaac Newhall were among the subscribers of the Massachusetts
                    Steam Navigation Company.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of papers of the Massachusetts Steam Navigation Company,
                    1816-1818. Materials include correspondence and financial records.
                    Correspondence details the financing and construction of the steamboat
                    Massachusetts as well as engines and parts for several uncompleted vessels
                    commissioned by the firm's shareholders. Other correspondence documents the
                    active life of the Massachusetts, financing of the firm, discussions about
                    repairs, and legal matters related to damages to the engine. Financial records
                    include accounts of the MSNC, lists of investments and earnings of shareholders,
                    and bills from individuals and firms who supplied goods and services for the
                    Massachusetts.</p>
