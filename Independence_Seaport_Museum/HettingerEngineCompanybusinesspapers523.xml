            <bioghist>
                <p>Hettinger Engine Company was located in Bridgeton, New Jersey. The company was a
                    primary manufacturer of gasoline engines used in various boats and dredgers in
                    the Delaware Bay area. The company was founded by Bridgeton mechanic Henry
                    Hettinger, who invented and built the Hettinger gasoline oyster dredge winding
                    machine, and the Hettinger gasoline marine engine that were used extensively in
                    the early 1900s along the East Coast. Just 23 in 1898 when he started the
                    Hettinger Engine Company, the inventor manufactured the first gasoline engine
                    built in Bridgeton. By then, he had already worked at two glass companies,
                    apprenticed in a machine shop and gone on to work at two machine shops,
                    including Oberlin Smith's Ferracute Machine Works. Hettinger invented and then
                    manufactured several machines used in canning, and build a four-cylinder engine
                    and airplane in 1909. Active in the community, Hettinger was noted for the time
                    and effort be put into the Liberty Loan and the Red Cross campaigns during World
                    War I.</p>

                <p>211 original engineer's technical drawings for marine engines manufactured
