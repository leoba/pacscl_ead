            <bioghist>
                <p>Thomas Pym Cope was already an established Philadelphia merchant in 1821 when he
                    began the first regular packet line between Philadelphia and Liverpool. The
                    business continued throughout most of the nineteenth century, with the company
                    name changing as successive generations assumed responsibility. The line also
                    developed a sizable passenger business.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of records of the shipping firm Thomas P. Cope and Son.
                    Materials include: bills of lading, manifests, and shipping articles for the
                    ship Alexander, 1820s-1830s; bills of lading and letters addressed to Thomas P.
                    Cope and Son related to the first voyage of the ship Tuscarora (1821-22). Many
                    of the letters are sent from Liverpool and are signed Rathbone Hodgson (cotton
                    merchants). Correspondence includes market reports. The collection also includes
                    a photograph of Captain Julius and his family, 1889; business cards of Theodore
                    Julius Jr., Commission Merchant; and an unsigned letter, presumably sent to
                    Theodore Julius. [a rate card for Cope's Line of Philadelphia and Liverpool
                    Packets -- not found in collection at time of survey, though there's a
                    photograph of some of the collection materials that shows it, so it's been here
                    in the recent past]</p>
