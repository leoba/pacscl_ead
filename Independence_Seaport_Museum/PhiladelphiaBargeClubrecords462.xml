            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Barge Club was formed in 1862 (until 1865, the club operated
                    under the name "Panola Barge Club"). It originally shared the boathouse of the
                    Pennsylvania Barge Club, until it was able to purchase the boathouse of the
                    National Boat Club in 1864. In 1870, the club moved into a newly constructed
                    boathouse, which it shared with the University Barge Club. The Anchorage House
                    was built in 1887 as an upriver house for the Philadelphia Barge Club. The
                    club's flag (crimson chevron on white) was adopted in 1870. The club was
                    absorbed by the University Barge Club in the 1930s. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of Philadelphia Barge Club record books. Included in the
                    collection are seven Anchorage House registers, 1888-1932, which record the
                    social and athletic engagements of the club and their use of Anchorage as an
                    upriver base where parties could be held. Typical entries in the Anchorage House
                    Registers include the weather, name of rowers/coxswain, menus, and guest lists.
                    A number of the volumes include sketches of rowing scenes, silhouettes of men
                    and women, and humorous scenes, many of which center on the cook. Poems and
                    ditties are also in evidence. Other collection materials include: two volumes of
                    minutes of the Elective Committee, 1889-1932; six volumes of minutes of club
                    meetings, 1862-1932 (the earliest volume covers the founding of the club); 20
                    Log books, 1875-1932; a club history, 1915; a Coxswain's book, 1883-1912; and a
                    Philadelphia Boat Club loan register, 1888-1912. Miscellaneous records include
                    membership nomination forms; membership information, 1915; a newspaper clipping;
                    a list of boats owned by the club, 1928; and lists of distances to various
                    points on the river. </p>
