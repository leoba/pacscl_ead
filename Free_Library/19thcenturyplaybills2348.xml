            <bioghist>
                <p>With a special focus on Philadelphia, the Theatre Collection of the Free Library
                    of Philadelphia contains research materials on the history of American theatre,
                    early film, and popular entertainment. The Theatre Collection maintains a
                    significant number of reference books, periodicals, programs, clipping files,
                    reviews, photographs, posters, film stills and other memorabilia. The collection
                    chronicles local theatre, with playbills dating back to 1803. It also maintains
                    the Lubin Film Company Archive (1912-1916), and other rare items on the silent
                    and classic film eras.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of over 100,000 playbills dating back to the 19th century.
                    The majority of playbills in the collection are from Philadelphia theaters, but
                    there are also selected playbills from New York and other cities in the
                    Northeastern United States. Philadelphia theaters represented include: the
                    Walnut Street Theater, the Academy of Music, the Arch Street Theater, the
                    Chestnut Street Theater, National Theater (Walnut Street), the National Theater
                    (Chestnut Street), the Melodeon, and the Continental Theater. The collection of
                    loose playbills and sets of playbills bound into volumes range in date from 1803
                    (from the Chestnut Street Theater) to 1902. The collection also contains
                    playbills from the Chestnut Street, Arch Street, and 11th Street opera houses;
                    and advertising sheets for several local museums, including the City Museum,
                    Col. Wood's Museum, and the Dime Museum. Notable among the items in the
                    collection are two sets of theatrical scrapbooks. The first, a set of 16
                    scrapbooks, documents the history of Philadelphia theater through playbills,
                    articles, and illustrations of actors clipped from popular magazines. These
                    volumes cover the period 1876 to 1902. The other set of scrapbooks were compiled
                    and donated to the Free Library by Paul E. Glase. These scrapbooks are arranged
                    by actor, and include playbills, programs, articles, and magazine illustrations.
                    The Glase scrapbooks include materials from Philadelphia and from New York,
                    Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington D.C. With the exception of the
                    Glase scrapbooks, most items in the collection are included in the Theatre
                    Collection's Philadelphia Theatre Index, which chronicles where and when
                    professional productions played in Philadelphia between 1855 and 2000.</p>
