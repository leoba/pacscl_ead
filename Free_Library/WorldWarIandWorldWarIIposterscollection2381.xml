            <bioghist>
                <p>Among the exemplary collections of the Free Library of Philadelphia is the Print
                    and Picture Collection. Spanning the graphic arts from 1493 to the present time,
                    the Free Library's Fine Art Prints and Photographs collection includes thousands
                    of images. Initially representing only Philadelphia artists, the collection has
                    been extended to include early masters as well as renowned modern printmakers
                    and photographers. </p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This extensive graphic collection consists of posters and placards produced
                    during World War I and prior to and during World War II. Printed by the U.S.
                    Government, governments of Britain, France and other European countries
                    (excluding Germany or Italy), as well as by non-governmental institutions, the
                    posters exhort civilians and servicemen to support the war effort. Subjects of
                    the posters include war bonds and relief funds; recruitment; safety and health;
                    food, energy, and materials conservation; the Red Cross; women's war efforts;
                    home defense; industrial production; and general patriotic themes. Some of the
                    artists were prominent painters and illustrators of the time, including Ben
                    Shahn and Norman Rockwell. The items in the collection vary in size from small
                    placards to very large wall posters. Most of the posters are in English, but
                    there are also posters in French, Polish, Russian, and other languages. The bulk
                    of the posters are from World War I.</p>
