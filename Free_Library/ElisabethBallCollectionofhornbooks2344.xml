            <bioghist>
                <p>Elisabeth Woodworth Ball (1897-1982) was the daughter of Frances and George Ball,
                    of the Ball glass manufacturing family of Muncie, Indiana. A hornbook is a book
                    that serves as primer for study. The hornbook originated in England in 1450. The
                    term has been applied to a few different study materials in different fields. In
                    children's education, in the years before modern education materials were used,
                    it referred to a leaf or page containing the alphabet, religious materials, and
                    other information, covered with a sheet of transparent horn and fixed in a frame
                    with a handle.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of 17th and 18th century hornbooks, primarily in wood, with
                    several in leather, silver, or ivory. The hornbooks vary from simple forms to
                    more elaborate frames with carved figures or letters. Some of the hornbooks have
                    an attached abacus. The collection also includes several 19th and 20th century
                    examples, including one with Arabic characters.</p>
