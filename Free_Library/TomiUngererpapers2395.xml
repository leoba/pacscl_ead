            <bioghist>
                <p>Tomi (Jean-Thomas) Ungerer (b. 1931) is a French illustrator best known for his
                    erotic and political illustrations and for his children's books. Ungerer was
                    born in Strasbourg in Alsace. Ungerer lived through the German occupation of
                    Alsace, during which period his house was requisitioned by the army of Nazi
                    Germany. Ungerer moved to the United States in 1956. The following year, Ungerer
                    published his first children's book for Harper &amp; Row, The Mellops Go Flying.
                    He also did illustration work for the New York Times and for television during
                    this time, and began to create posters denouncing the Vietnam War. After
                    Allumette; A Fable, with Due Respect to Hans Christian Andersen, the Grimm
                    Brothers, and the Honorable Ambrose Bierce was published in 1974, Ungerer spent
                    more than twenty years writing books for adults. In 1998, with the publication
                    of Flix, he made his return to children's literature. Ungerer currently lives in
                    Ireland, where he and his wife moved in 1976. In 1998, Tomi Ungerer was awarded
                    the Hans Christian Andersen Award for illustration. In 2007, the Mus√©e Tomi
                    Ungerer was opened in his honor in Strasbourg.</p>
