                <p>The United States Geologic Survey took over responsibility for mapping the
                    country in 1879 and has been the primary civilian mapping agency of the United
                    States ever since. The best known USGS maps are the 1:24,000-scale topographic
                    maps, also known as 7.5-minute quadrangles. More than 55,000 7.5-minute maps
                    were made to cover the 48 conterminous States. This is the only uniform map
                    series that covers the entire area of the United States in considerable detail.
                    The 7.5-minute map series was officially completed in 1992.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of United States Geologic Survey maps. Materials include:
                    current 1:24,000 scale maps for all U.S. states and territories; historical
                    1:24,000 scale maps for Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, and Maryland (7.5
                    minute series); older 15 minute series maps for many areas (mostly 1950s-1990s;
                    historical maps go back to 1894); 1:100,000 scale maps for various quadrangles
                    of the U.S. states (mostly 1970s-1990s); and 1:250.000 scale maps for various
                    quadrangles of the U.S. states (mostly 1970s-1990s).</p>
