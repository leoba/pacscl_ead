            <bioghist>
                <p>The Free Library of Philadelphia was founded in 1891 as the city's first public
                    library system. Its Rare Book Department, among the largest in American public
                    libraries, exists to serve the people of Philadelphia, as well as the students,
                    scholars, and researchers who use its collections. The Rare Book Department's
                    holding span 5000 years, from cuneiform tablets to 20th century literary
                    manuscripts. Among the many collecting areas of the department are incunabula,
                    American, European, and Oriental manuscripts, art and artist's papers,
                    children's books and manuscripts, manuscripts and correspondence of American and
                    British authors, examples of calligraphy, and Pennsylvania German fraktur. The
                    Rare Book Department has major collections of Oliver Goldsmith, Charles Dickens,
                    Edgar Allan Poe, Horace editions, Beatrix Potter, Arthur Rackham, and Robert
                    Lawson.</p>
