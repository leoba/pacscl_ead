            <bioghist>
                <p>Marguerite de Angeli (1889-1987) was a bestselling author and illustrator of
                    children's books including the 1950 Newbery Award winning book The Door in the
                    Wall. She wrote and illustrated twenty-eight of her own books, and illustrated
                    more than three dozen books and numerous magazine stories and articles for other
                    authors. She was twice named a Caldecott Honor Book illustrator, first in 1945
                    for Yonie Wondernose and again in 1955 for Book of Nursery and Mother Goose
                    Rhymes and she received a 1957 Newbery Honor mention for Black Fox of Lorne. In
                    her illustrations de Angeli employed a number of different media, including
                    charcoal, pen and ink, lithograph (only in earliest work), oils, and
                    watercolors. Her works explored and depicted the rich cultural diversity of
                    common people in America. Many of her books were set in Philadelphia,
                    Pennsylvania.</p>
