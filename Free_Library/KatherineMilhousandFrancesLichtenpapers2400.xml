            <bioghist>
                <p>Katherine Milhous (1894-1977) was a artist and children's book author. She
                    attended art school at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and the
                    Pennsylvania Museum of Industrial Art. During the Depression, she served as the
                    head of a Federal Art Project for the Works Progress Administration. Milhousâ€™s
                    first children's book illustrations were for author Alice Dalgliesh. In 1940,
                    her first book, Lovina, was published. Her most famous book was The Egg Tree,
                    which won the 1951 Caldecott Award. Frances Lichten was an artist and decorator.
                    She was a specialist on the rural folk art of Pennsylvania. From 1938 to 1941,
                    she was supervisor of the Index for American Design for Pennsylvania. She
                    collaborated with Katherine Milhous on illustrations for some children's books,
                    including They Live in South America, by Alice Dalgleish. She was the author of
                    The Folk Art of Rural Pennsylvania (1946).</p>
