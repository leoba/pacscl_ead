            <bioghist>
                <p>Evaline (Michelow) Ness (1911-1986) was a children's book author and illustrator.
                    In addition to her own books, Ness illustrated books for such well-known
                    children's writers as Lloyd Alexander and Stephen Kroll. She was a runner-up for
                    the Caldecott Medal for three straight years before she won it in 1967 for her
                    book Sam, Bangs and Moonshine. In addition to the Caldecott Medal, Ness won ALA
                    Notable Book, Horn Book Honors, and the Hans Christian Anderson Award for books
                    produced from the 1950s to the 1970s. In 1938 Evaline married FBI agent Eliot
                    Ness. They divorced in 1946. She married Arnold Bayard in 1959.</p>
