                <p>Among the exemplary collections of the Free Library of Philadelphia is the Print
                    and Picture Collection. Spanning the graphic arts from 1493 to the present time,
                    the Free Library's Fine Art Prints and Photographs collection includes thousands
                    of images. Initially representing only Philadelphia artists, the collection has
                    been extended to include early masters as well as renowned modern printmakers
                    and photographers. </p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of 5" x 7" and 8" x 10" black and white photographic
                    negatives of properties in Philadelphia and the vicinity, including Mongomery,
                    Berks, Delaware, and Chester counties. There are also some negatives from
                    Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Images are of industrial and business
                    properties and residences. There are occasional interior shots, a small batch of
                    aerial negatives, and miscellaneous photographs of damage to properties and
                    automobiles. The collection also includes three binders of 8 x 10 prints of
                    downtown Philadelphia from the late 1940s and early 1950s.</p>
