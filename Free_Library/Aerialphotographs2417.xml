                <p>The Aero Service Corporation began in 1919 in Philadelphia and was a pioneer and
                    world leader in aerial photography and photogrammetry. Directed by Virgil I.
                    Kauffman, a World War I veteran pilot who joined the company in 1924, the firm
                    obtained lucrative government and private contracts including those with the
                    United States Geological Survey and the Tennessee Valley Authority that involved
                    some of the first aerial surveys of the country. </p>

                <p>This is a collection of approximately 800 aerial photographs of Philadelphia and
                    the surrounding area. The majority of photographs in the collection were taken
                    by the Aero-Service Corporation, between 1926 and 1964. The photographs are 19
                    3/4" x 15 1/2" black and white oblique aerial views. A smaller number of
                    photographs in the collection were taken by the Dallin Company. Also included is
                    a print of the first aerial photograph taken of Philadelphia: an 1893 view taken
                    by W.N. Jennings from the balloon "Eagle Eyrie." These aerial views show
                    neighborhoods and Philadelphia's downtown; transportation and industrial
                    infrastructure; schools and hospitals; and the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers.
                    The collection also includes several newspapers clippings that feature aerial
                    photographs.</p>

                <p>The collection is open for research.</p>
