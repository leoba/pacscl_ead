            <bioghist>
                <p>Richard Gimbel (1898-1970), was a leading rare-book and manuscript collector and
                    the son of the founder of Gimbel's department store. Gimbel began collecting
                    while serving with the 8th U.S. Army Air Force in England during World War II,
                    and continued after becoming curator of aeronautical literature at Yale
                    University. In 1933 Gimbel purchased the Edgar Allen Poe Home in Philadelphia.
                    An avid fan of Poe, he refurbished the home and opened it as a museum. The
                    National Park Service began overseeing the property in 1978, reopening the home
                    in 1980. Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American poet, short-story writer,
                    editor and literary critic, and is considered part of the American Romantic
                    Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of
                    the earliest American practitioners of the short story and is considered the
                    inventor of the detective-fiction genre.</p>
