            <bioghist>
                <p>Alfred Bendiner (1899-1964) was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended
                    Northeast High School in Philadelphia and the Pennsylvania Museum School of
                    Industrial Arts before entering the Army in 1918. He received both a bachelor's
                    of architecture degree in 1922 and a master's degree in 1927 from the University
                    of Pennsylvania. In 1937, he served as artist for the University Museum's
                    archeological expedition to Tepe Gawra and Khafaji, Iraq. He was architect to
                    the university's Tikal-Tikal archeological expedition to Guatemala in 1960.
                    Bendiner held membership in F.A.I.A and served as president for the Philadelphia
                    Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He published widely, with books
                    including Music to My Eyes (1952), Bendiner's Philadelphia (1964), and
                    contributions to magazines such as Atlantic Monthly and Harper's.</p>
