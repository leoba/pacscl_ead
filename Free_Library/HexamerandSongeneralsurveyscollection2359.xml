            <bioghist>
                <p>Ernest Hexamer was a civil engineer and surveyor. Hexamer along with William
                    Locher introduced a series of insurance maps of Philadelphia in 1857. Their
                    series was continued, with enlargements, until 1915, when the Hexamer and
                    Sanborn companies merged.</p>
