                <p>This richly illustrated collection of scrapbooks was assembled by Samuel Castner,
                    Jr. Most items date to the 19th century, though a few items, dating up to 1962,
                    were added after the scrapbooks were donated to the Free Library. The scrapbooks
                    contain various items of Philadelphiana: photographs, prints, watercolors,
                    drawings, postcards, booklets, newspaper and magazine clippings, and other
                    printed and manuscript materials. The scrapbooks are organized by location,
                    building type, or theme. Artists represented in the collection include William
                    and Thomas Birch, Cephas G. Childs, Augustus KÃ¶llner, the Langenheim brothers,
                    and Frank H. Taylor. The collection also includes photographic prints of
                    selected images from volumes 2-22 and negatives of selected images from the
                    entire run of scrapbooks.</p>
