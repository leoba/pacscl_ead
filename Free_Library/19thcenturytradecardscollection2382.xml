            <bioghist>
                <p>Trade cards were typically used to advertise products and services including such
                    items as patent medicines, thread, sewing machines, food and beverages, and farm
                    equipment. Trade cards reached the height of their popularity during the 1880s
                    and 1890s. Around the turn of the century, decreasing postal rates and the
                    increase of venues for printed advertisements contributed to the decline in the
                    use of trade cards.</p>
