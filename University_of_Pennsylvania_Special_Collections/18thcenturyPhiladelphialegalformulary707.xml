            <bioghist>
                <p>Jared Ingersoll (1749-1822) was an early American lawyer and statesman from
                    Philadelphia. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress and signed the U.S.
                    Constitution for Pennsylvania. He joined DeWitt Clinton on the Federalist Party
                    ticket for the U.S. presidential election in 1812, but they were defeated.
                    Ingersoll also served as Pennsylvania state attorney general, 1791-1800 and
                    1811-1816 and as the United States Attorney for Pennsylvania, 1800-1801.</p>
