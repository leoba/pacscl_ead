                <p>This collection consists of three scrapbooks on theater and opera (1858-1909).
                    The books include illustrations and photographs from magazines and newspapers;
                    cabinet cards, photographs, and cyanotypes; playbills and programs; sheet music;
                    and articles, reviews, and advertisements from magazines and newspapers. Many of
                    the items are for performances in Philadelphia; venues include the Walnut Street
                    Theater, the Arch Street Theater, the Chestnut Street Theater, Garrick's
                    Theater, the Chestnut Street Opera House, and the American Academy of Music.
                    There are also several items from theaters and opera houses in Boston, New York,
                    London, and Paris. One volume is largely focused on the Augustin Daly Company
                    and its Philadelphia performances.</p>
