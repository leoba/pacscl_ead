                <p>William R. Mathews (1893-1969) was the editor and publisher of the Arizona Daily
                    Star. John Foster Dulles (1888-1959) served as U.S. Secretary of State under
                    President Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1959.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of letters between William R. Mathews and John Foster
                    Dulles, 1941 to 1957. The two men exchanged thoughts on foreign policy, from the
                    lead-up to American involvement in the war in Europe to the Korean War. The
                    collection also includes Mathews's diary of Dulles's 1950 trip to Korea, for
                    which Mathews was a correspondent. The collection includes excerpts of Dulles
                    addresses that the Secretary of State sent to Mathews. There are also several
                    pamphlets authored by Dulles, and several newspaper clippings. The collection
                    also includes several letters from Dulles's widow to Mathews (1961-1964).</p>
