            <bioghist>
                <p>Eugene Ormandy (1899-1985) was a Hungarian-born conductor and violinist. Ormandy
                    came to the US in 1921 and joined the orchestra of the Capitol Theater, becoming
                    its associate music director in 1926. From 1931 to 1936 he became conductor of
                    the Minneapolis Symphony. In 1936 he was invited to become co-conductor of the
                    Philadelphia Orchestra, sharing the podium with Leopold Stokowski. He was made
                    music director in 1938. During the 44 years of his tenure, the orchestra made
                    many recordings with RCA and with Columbia Records, toured frequently, and
                    broadcast performances on radio and television. Although he retired as conductor
                    of the Philadelphia Orchestra at the end of the 1979-1980 season, he continued
                    to appear as conductor laureate and guest conducted all over the US and in
                    Europe.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of 129 reel-to-reel tapes and 30 cassette tapes of
                    performances by the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Eugene Ormandy and of
                    performances by other orchestras, including the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland
                    Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic. The recordings include air checks from
                    WFLN's series of Philadelphia Orchestra transcriptions, demo tapes of novel
                    compositions and of performers. A number of the recordings appear to have been
                    made by the Magnetic Recorder and Reproducer Corp. In addition to the tapes, the
                    collection also includes a commemorative diploma presented to Ormandy by the
                    government of Hungary on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Zoltan
                    Kodaly's birth.</p>
