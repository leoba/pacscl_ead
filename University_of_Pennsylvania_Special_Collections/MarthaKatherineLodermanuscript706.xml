            <bioghist>
                <p>Martha Loder (b. 1914) was born in Bridgeton, New Jersey. She received her
                    bachelor's degree from Dickinson College, where she was a member of the Phi Beta
                    Kappa Honors fraternity. She continued her education at the University of
                    Pennsylvania and in 1943, earned her Ph.D. in romance languages. The subject of
                    her doctoral thesis was Leon Gozlan (1808-1866), a French playwright and
                    novelist. After graduation, Loder became head of the English department at
                    Bridgeton High School. On March 4, 1950, she earned the American Legion Award of
                    Merit for distinguished service.</p>
