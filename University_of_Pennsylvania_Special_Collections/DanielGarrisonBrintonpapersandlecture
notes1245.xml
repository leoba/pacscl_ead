            <bioghist>
                <p>Daniel Garrison Brinton (1837-1899) was an American archaeologist and
                    ethnologist. During the Civil War, he was a surgeon in the Union army. After the
                    war, Brinton practiced medicine in West Chester, Pennsylvania for several years
                    before joining the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia as a professor of
                    ethnology and archaeology in 1884. In 1886 he became professor of American
                    linguistics and archaeology in the University of Pennsylvania. From 1874 to 1887
                    he was editor of the weekly Medical and Surgical Reporter.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of the papers of Daniel Garrison Brinton. Most of the
                    materials relate to his professional life, but there is also a small amount of
                    family correspondence in the collection. Brinton's professional papers include
                    correspondence; lecture notes on American Indian origins, languages, ethnology,
                    and on American and Central American archeology; scrapbooks of Briton's
                    "Current Notes on Anthropology" column; a scrapbook of newspaper clippings and
                    several photographs on American Indians, in Spanish and English; reprints of
                    articles by Brinton and others; hand-drawn and printed maps, many of Mexico and
                    South America; and several volumes containing Brinton's notes and extracts from
                    texts on Central and North American Indian ethnology and language, comparative
                    religion, and American history. These volumes include two notebooks focusing on
                    the Tzental (Tzeltal) Indians in Mexico. The collection also includes several
                    memorials and obituaries of Brinton. </p>
