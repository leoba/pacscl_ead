                <p>The collection consists of papers resulting from Silver's work in the summer of
                    1939 when he was photographing materials for his Harvard doctoral thesis

                    film reels runs from 199 through 639 -- not all numbers are present); an index

                    reels; and a ledger listing microfilm reels that were deposited at Temple.</p>
