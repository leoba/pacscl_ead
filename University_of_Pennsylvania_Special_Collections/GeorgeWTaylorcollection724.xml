            <bioghist>
                <p>George W. Taylor (1901-1972) was a professor of industrial relations at the
                    Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He has been called "the
                    father of American arbitration." Over his course of his career, he settled more
                    than 2000 strikes, and served as labor advisor to five U.S. presidents and
                    mentor to many labor economists in government and academia. In 1967, he helped
                    draft the New York state civil service law which legalized collective bargaining
                    in that state but which also banned strikes by public employeesâ€”legislation
                    widely known today as the Taylor Law.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of the papers of George W. Taylor documenting his work in
                    labor-management arbitration. Cases represented in this collection include the
                    1959 Steel Workers of America strike, the Operating Engineers (Philadelphia)
                    case of 1950-1954, a 1963 rail workers dispute, and a 1962 airline pilot's
                    dispute. Materials related to these cases include memos, correspondence,
                    position statements, agreements, reports, transcriptions of testimony at
                    hearings, and newspaper clippings. Several cases include reports to Congress and
                    the President on the arbitration's progress and outcomes. The collection also
                    documents the arbitration case between Kaiser Steel and the Steel Workers of
                    America, with memos, correspondence, minutes, monthly reports, printed copies of
                    agreements, newsletters, press releases. There are also records of Taylor's work
                    on the President's Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy, and several of
                    that group's subcommittees (including Monetary and Fiscal Policy, Technology and
                    Automation, and Pensions). These materials include memos, minutes, reports of
                    the Advisory Committee, bulletins and reports of the Labor Department and other
                    government offices. Other materials in the collection include summaries and
                    notes for jurisdictional disputes of the Congress of Industrial Organizations;
                    minutes of the Advisory Board of the Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion
                    (1944-1946); and printed bulletins and press releases from the Wage
                    Stabilization Board (1951-1952).</p>
