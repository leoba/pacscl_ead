            <bioghist>
                <p>The merchant bank William Brandt's Sons &amp; Co. Ltd., was established by a
                    German mercantile family. E H Brandt opened his first office in London in 1805
                    where his postal address was Batson's Coffee House. A branch of the firm had
                    also been opened in Archangel, Russia in 1802. In 1861 the company became
                    insolvent but Augustus Brandt and others managed to secure 10,000 pounds to save
                    the company. The firm traded exclusively with Russia (particularly in Archangel,
                    Riga and St. Petersburg) until 1875 when it began trading in Argentinean grain
                    movements and meat refrigeration. It also had interests in sugar and cotton
                    mills. It took over the Calcutta house of Scholvin and Co. in 1886 and thereby
                    extended its interests to India. The company had the name William Brandt's Sons
                    and Company Limited at the time with offices at 4 Fenchurch Avenue in the City
                    of London.</p>
