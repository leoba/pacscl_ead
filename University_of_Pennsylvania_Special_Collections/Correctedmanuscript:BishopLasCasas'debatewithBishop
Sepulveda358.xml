            <bioghist>
                <p>The Valladolid debate (1550-1551) concerned the treatment of natives of the New
                    World. Held in the Spanish city of Valladolid, it opposed two main attitudes
                    towards the conquests of the New World. Dominican friar and Bishop of Chiapas
                    Bartolomé de las Casas argued that the Amerindians were free men in the natural
                    order and deserved the same treatment as others, according to Catholic theology.
                    Opposing him was Jesuit Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, who insisted the Indians were
                    natural slaves, and therefore reducing them to slavery or serfdom was in
                    accordance with Catholic theology and natural law. Las Casas and Sepúlveda each
                    later claimed to have won the debate, but no record supporting either claim
                    exists, and the debate had no clear effect on the treatment of the natives.</p>

                <p>This is a 41 page manuscript in the hand of Bishop las Casas of part of what was
                    later referred to as the "Nine Tracts." This appears to be a corrected
                    manuscript and differs in some details from the printed version.</p>
