            <bioghist>
                <p>Joseph Henry (1797-1878) was an American scientist who served as the first
                    Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution from 1846 to 1878. He also served as
                    President of the National Academy of Sciences from 1868-1878. During his
                    lifetime, Henry was considered one of the greatest American scientists since
                    Benjamin Franklin. He made a number of significant discoveries. While building
                    electromagnets, Henry discovered the electromagnetic phenomenon of
                    self-inductance. He also discovered mutual inductance independently of Faraday,
                    though Faraday was the first to publish his results. Henry's work on the
                    electromagnetic relay was the basis of the electrical telegraph, jointly
                    invented by Samuel Morse and Charles Wheatstone.</p>
