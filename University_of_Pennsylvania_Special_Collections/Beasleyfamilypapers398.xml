                    degree in 1868. He was rector of All Saints Church in Lower Dublin,
                    Pennsylvania. His father, Frederick Beasley (1777-1845), was ordained a deacon
                    in the Episcopal Church in 1801 and a priest the following year. After serving
                    as rector of several congregations in New Jersey, New York, and Maryland,

                    received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the University in 1815. </p>
