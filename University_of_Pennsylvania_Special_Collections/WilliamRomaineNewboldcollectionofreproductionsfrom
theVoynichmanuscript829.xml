            <bioghist>
                <p>The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated manuscript in an unknown language,
                    thought to have been written between 1470 and 1500. It is named after the
                    Polish-American book-dealer Wilfrid M. Voynich, who acquired it in 1912. It has
                    been the subject of intense study by cryptographers. In 1921, William Romaine
                    Newbold, a professor of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, offered
                    the first decryption of the manuscript, but his work has since been
                    discredited.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection consists of reproductions of 57 plates from the Voynich
                    manuscript, used by William Newbold for his book The Cipher of Roger Bacon. The
                    plates are hand-colored photostats of some of the plates in the manuscript,
                    which is held by the Beinecke Library at Yale. The collection also includes a
                    list of plates in Newbold's book.</p>
