                <p>Dr. Martin Christadler was on the faculty of the University of Tubingen and
                    Marieluise Christadler was a teacher of civics in secondary schools. The couple
                    came to Philadelphia in 1965 as fellows in American Studies under the American
                    Council of Learned Societies. Dr. Christadler was doing research on the American
                    essay of the 18th and 19th centuries. Mrs. Christadler was interested in the
                    Civil Rights movement.</p>
