            <bioghist>
                <p>George A. Q. Miller was stationed in Chicago as Special Postal Agent for the Post
                    Office from 1869 to 1873. Miller devised a scheme of using covered mail wagons
                    as opposed to open drays to minimize postal theft.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of correspondence and clippings related to the postal career
                    of George A. Q. Miller. Materials include a scrapbook of clippings about
                    Miller's idea for using secured covered mail wagons and about civil service
                    awards and other miscellaneous subjects. Miller's commentary is penciled in next
                    to some of the clippings. Correspondence includes letters from Rutherford B.
                    Hayes, James A. Garfield, and John Wanamaker (Postmaster General from
                    1889-1893), as well as a small batch of letters regarding an unsuccessful
                    attempt to remove Miller from the postal service for drunk and disorderly
                    conduct. The collection also includes a cabinet photograph of George Miller and
                    several pamphlets on civil service reform.</p>
