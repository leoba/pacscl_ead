            <bioghist>
                <p>Alfred Gemmell received his master's degree in history from the University of
                    Pennsylvania in 1947. William Darrah Kelley (1814-1890) was a judge and
                    politician from Philadelphia. He served as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas
                    for Philadelphia from 1846-1856. Kelley was elected as a Republican to Congress
                    in 1860 and served from March 4, 1861, until his death.</p>
