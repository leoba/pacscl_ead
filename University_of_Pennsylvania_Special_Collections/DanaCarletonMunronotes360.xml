            <bioghist>
                <p>Dana Carleton Munro (1866-1933) was a historian and influential scholar of the
                    Crusades. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania from 1893-1902 and at the
                    University of Wisconsin from 1902-1915. He then joined the faculty of Princeton
                    University, where he was the chair of the history department from 1916-1928 and
                    the first Dodge Professor of History. He published a number of texts on the
                    Middle Ages and medieval civilization, including A History of the Middle Ages
                    (1902).</p>
