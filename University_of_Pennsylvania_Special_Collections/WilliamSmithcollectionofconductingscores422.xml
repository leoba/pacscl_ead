            <bioghist>
                <p>William Smith (1924-1993) was an associate conductor of the Philadelphia
                    Orchestra. Smith was a pianist and musicologist who had studied at the
                    University of Pennsylvania. He joined the orchestra as principal keyboard player
                    in 1952 and was made assistant conductor that year. He was named associate
                    conductor in 1976.</p>
