            <bioghist>
                <p>Richard Penn Smith (1799-1854) was a Philadelphia playwright and lawyer. He was
                    part of the Philadelphia School of Dramatists and his plays included "Quite
                    Correct," "The Triumph at Plattsburg," and "William Penn."</p>

                <p>This is a collection of the letters of Richard Penn Smith from friends and
                    acquaintances. A number of the letters are responses to invitations to two
                    memorial dinners -- one for Edwin Forrest, and the other for Frederick Marryat.
                    Some letters are requests for repayment of loans and settling of the debts of
                    his brother William. Correspondents include William Cullen Bryant, Mathew Carey,
                    Edwin Forrest, Horace Greeley, Washington Irving, and Thomas Sully. The
                    collection also includes an engraved portrait of Smith.</p>
