            <bioghist>
                <p>Victor Bockris (b.1949) is an English-born, U.S.-based author, primarily of
                    biographies of artists, writers, and musicians. He graduated from the University
                    of Pennsylvania in 1971. While in Philadelphia, he founded Telegraph Books. He
                    moved to New York City in 1973 and became an associate of Warhol and Burroughs.
                    He worked for Warhol at the Factory and published many pieces in Warhol's
                    magazine Interview, often in collaboration with Andrew Wylie, now best known as
                    a literary agent. He has written about Lou Reed (and The Velvet Underground),
                    Andy Warhol, Keith Richards, William S. Burroughs, Terry Southern, Blondie,
                    Patti Smith, and Muhammad Ali. He also helped write the autobiographies of John
                    Cale and Bebe Buell.</p>
