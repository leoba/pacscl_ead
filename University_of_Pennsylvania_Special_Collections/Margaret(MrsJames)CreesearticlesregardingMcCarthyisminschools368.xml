                <p>The collection contains newspaper and magazine articles on the influence of
                    McCarthyism in schools collected by Margaret Creese. There are articles on
                    attacks on teachers, textbooks, and curricula in magazines such as McCall's,
                    Journal of the American Association of University Women, and the NEA Journal, as
                    well as two copies of an article printed in the American Legion Magazine in 1952
                    entitled "Your Child Is Their Target" about the inroads into public education
                    made by ideological forces of collectivism and socialism. The collection also
                    includes several NEA brochures from the period and a 1952 letter from the
                    Teachers Union of Philadelphia about the danger to civil liberties and public
