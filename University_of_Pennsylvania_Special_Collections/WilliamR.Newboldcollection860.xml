            <bioghist>
                <p>William Romaine Newbold (1865-1926) was the Adam Seybert Professor of
                    Intellectual and Moral Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania from
                    1907-1926. He served as Dean of the Graduate School from 1896-1904. He did (now
                    discredited) work on deciphering the coded text known as the Voynich
                    Manuscript.</p>

                <p>This is a typed manuscript of William R. Newbold's "Greek Theories of Sound and
                    Consonance," 1907. The manuscript is annotated with excerpts of text in Greek
                    and corrections in English. It was never published. The collection also includes

                    University Library.</p>
