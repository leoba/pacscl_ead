                    Pennsylvania. His advisors were Joseph E. Gillet, and, following Gillet's death,
                    Otis H. Green.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of Mexican dramatic material assembled by Roberto Morgadanes
                    during field work in Mexico for his graduate studies. in which he researched the
                    origins of drama in colonial Mexico. Materials include: manuscript and
                    typescript dramatic manuscripts, 1868-1934 (some of the transcripts appear to be
                    of older pieces -- dating to the 16th century); and correspondence (1940-1942)
                    between Morgadanes and members of the University of Pennsylvania's Department of
                    Romance Languages (mostly Otis H. Green) about Morgadanes' enrollment in the
                    department and the progress of his studies.</p>
