            <bioghist>
                <p>Robert Montgomery Bird (1806-1854) was an American writer, photographer, and
                    physician. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania's Medical School and
                    College of Pharmacy in 1827. He wrote several verse plays for the actor Edwin
                    Forrest , most notably "The Gladiator" (1831) and "The Broker of Bogota"
                    (1834). He also wrote fiction, including The Infidel (1835), Sheppard Lee (1836)
                    and Nick of the Woods (1837), and was the editor of American Monthly magazine.
                    He married Mary Mayer in 1837 and they had a son, Frederick, in 1838. He took up
                    photography late in life.</p>
