            <bioghist>
                <p>Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) was a major English Romantic poet, a literary
                    critic and a philosopher. His most famous works are The Rime of the Ancient
                    Mariner and Kubla Khan. Hyman Hurwitz (1770-1844) was born at Posen in Poland
                    and raised in the Jewish community there. He came to England about 1800 and
                    opened a private academy for Jews at Highgate, Middlesex, where he became a
                    close friend of Coleridge. Hurwitz was appointed the first Professor of Hebrew
                    Language and Literature at the University of College London in 1828.</p>
