                <p>This collection consists of a manuscript bibliography of dictionaries, religious
                    works, and Bibles. Works included in the bibliography date from the 16th to the
                    19th century. The works are in many languages, including English, French,
                    German, Russian, Greek, Italian, Armenian, Basque, several Indic Languages,
                    Chinese, and many others. The bibliography appears to have been compiled in the
                    late 19th century. </p>
