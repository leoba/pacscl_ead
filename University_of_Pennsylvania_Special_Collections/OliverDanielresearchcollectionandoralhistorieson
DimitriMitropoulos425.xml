            <bioghist>
                <p>Dimitri Mitropoulos (1896-1960) was a Greek conductor, pianist, and composer who
                    spent most of his career in the United States. Oliver Daniel (1911-1990) was an
                    American arts administrator, musicologist, and composer. Daniel did extensive
                    research on Mitropoulos, including interviews with many of his colleagues and
                    contemporaries. Daniel died before his biography of Mitropoulos was completed.
                    Daniel Ott, the executor of Daniel's estate, asked William Trotter to take over
                    the project. Trotter's book, Priest of Music: The Life of Dimitri Mitropoulos
                    was published by Amadeus Press in 1995.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection contains research conducted by Oliver Daniel on Dimitri
                    Mitropoulos. The bulk of the collection consists of audiocassette recordings of
                    interviews with musicians who worked with Mitropolous, and transcriptions of
                    those interviews. There are also newspaper clippings, program notes, and
                    biographical information about the interview subjects, and correspondence from
                    Daniel and from Daniel Ott with the interview subjects related to the interviews
                    and the production of the book. There are also photographs and negatives of
                    Mitropolous at work and at leisure and several printed works on Mitropoulos,
                    including a discography, biographies, and commemorative programs. The collection
                    also includes copies of FBI files on Mitropolous.</p>
