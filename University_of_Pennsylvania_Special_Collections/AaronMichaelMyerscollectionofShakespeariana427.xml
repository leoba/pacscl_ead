                    received his doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania in 1931. He and his

                <p>This is a collection of clippings, brochures, programs, postcards, and
                    photographs related to England and Shakespearean theater, assembled by Aaron
                    Michael Myers. The bulk of the collection consists of scrapbook pages from
                    Myers' trip to England in the 1930s, arranged by location, with postcards,
                    travel brochures, photographs, and programs. Included are playbills from
                    performances at the Shakespeare Memorial Theater in Stratford Upon Avon, with
                    manuscript annotations by Myers, and issues of the Shakespeare Pictorial
                    (1940-1942). The collection also includes playbills and clippings of reviews of
                    performances of Shakespeare plays at several Philadelphia theaters, including
                    the Broad Street Theater, the Abbey Theater, the Garrick Theater, and the
                    Forrest Theater. </p>
