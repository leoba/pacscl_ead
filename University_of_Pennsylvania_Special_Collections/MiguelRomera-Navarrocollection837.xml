            <bioghist>
                <p>Miguel Romera-Navarro (1888-1954) was a university professor and scholar of
                    Spanish language literature. Born in Spain, he received his bachelor's degree
                    from the University of Madrid, and his master's and doctoral degrees from the
                    University of Pennsylvania. He joined the faculty of Penn in 1916 (becoming a
                    full professor in 1927) and remained there until 1947. He then took a position
                    as chair of Spanish at the University of Texas, where he remained until his
                    death. He wrote many books and articles, and was active in the founding of the
                    Hispanic Review.</p>
