            <bioghist>
                <p>Eduard Dorsch (1822-1887) grew up in Germany. He emigrated to the United States
                    in 1849, where he ran a successful practice as a physician in Monroe, Michigan,
                    and wrote articles for several German-language newspapers. He also wrote poetry,
                    painted and grew flowers. He willed his home and library collection to the city
                    of Monroe to be used as a library.</p>
