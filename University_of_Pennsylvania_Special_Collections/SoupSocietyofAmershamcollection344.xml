                    poor.</p>

                    receiving the aid; recipes for soup; information on steam kitchens, including
                    diagrams; a small amount of information about the Spitalfield Soup Society; a
                    manuscript copy of "Extracts of Count Rumford's Experimental Essays"; and a
                    letter from a parish resident explaining why he declined to subscribe to the
                    Society. The materials all appear to date from 1798-1801.</p>
