            <bioghist>
                <p>Julian A. Sterling was a surgeon at the Albert Einstein Medical Center in
                    Philadelphia. Silas Weir Mitchell (1829-1914) was an American physician and
                    writer. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania and received his M.D. from
                    Jefferson Medical College in 1850. During the Civil War he worked with patients
                    suffering from nervous injuries and maladies, and at the close of the war became
                    a specialist in neurology. In this field Weir Mitchell's name became prominently
                    associated with his introduction of the rest cure for nervous diseases,
                    particularly hysteria. His medical texts include Injuries of Nerves and Their
                    Consequences and Fat and Blood. Mitchell also wrote several historical novels
                    including Hugh Wynne, Free Quaker, The Adventures of Fran√ßois, and The Red
                    City.</p>
