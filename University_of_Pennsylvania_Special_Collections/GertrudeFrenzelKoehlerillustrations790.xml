            <bioghist>
                <p>Gertrude Franzel-Koehler lived in Hellerau, near Dresden, Germany. She
                    illustrated these texts for Dr. Ernst Jockers of the University of Pennsylvania.
                    She once saw a poem by Dr. Jockers in a German newspaper and liked it so much
                    that she illustrated it and sent it to him. She sent him other sheets over a
                    period of about seven years (1948-1955). She was a personal friend of Gerhart
                    Hauptmann and wrote all of his poems and many of his plays in this manner. She
                    also wrote original poetry. Her husband was in charge of the restoration of the
                    Zwinger in Dresden, which had been destroyed during World War II.</p>
