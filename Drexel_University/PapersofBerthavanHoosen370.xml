                <p>General correspondence, [1917-1940], reflecting Van Hoosen's work in obstetrics
                    and gynecology, including birth control, and also her interest in women in
                    medicine. A large part of the correspondence concerns Van Hoosen's interests in
                    the National Medical Women's Association, later the American Medical Women's
                    Women's Association, later the American Medical Women's Association, with
                    letters from missionaries in China and India. Materials, [(1940-1961)-1971],
                    reveal Van Hoosen's efforts to create, at Woman's Medical College, a Medical
                    Women's Library on the history of women in medicine, and contain correspondence
                    with physicians and with librarians around the world compiling bibliographies on
                    the subject, notebooks listing some of the books presented to the Library, and
                    related materials. Card index of women physicians and some medical institutions
                    mentioned in Medical Woman's Journal, 1941-1948.</p>
