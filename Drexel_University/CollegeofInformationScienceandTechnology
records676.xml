                <p>What is now the College of Information Science and Technology (previously the
                    Library and Reading Room, 1892-1914; School of Library Science, 1922-1954,
                    Graduate School of Library Science, 1954-1978; School of Library and Information
                    Science, 1978-1984; College of Information Studies, 1984-1995) was founded in

                <p>This collection spans the entire history of the college, but the bulk of the
                    material is administrative records (reports, faculty and staff meeting minutes,
                    personnel files, grants, curriculum, etc.) dating mostly from the 1950s through
                    the 1990s. The collection also includes some student records; materials about
                    specific deans, directors, and alumni; a series relating to the Rush Building;
                    publications; publicity materials; photographs; and programs and memorabilia.
                    Some of the files contain letters by Guy Garrison, retired dean of the college,
                    who was responsible for transferring the collection to the archives.</p>
