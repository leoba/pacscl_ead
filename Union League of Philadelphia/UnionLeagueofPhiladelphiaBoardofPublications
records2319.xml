            <bioghist>
                <p>The Union League of Philadelphia was founded in 1862 as a patriotic society to
                    support the policies of President Abraham Lincoln. It evolved to its current
                    identity as a non-sectarian and non-partisan private club. The Board of
                    Publications was one of the original standing committees responsible for one of
                    the League's primary functions: to disseminate patriotic literature in support
                    of the Union. The Board first met February 26, 1863; original Board resigned
                    December 6, 1864; new Board formed February 15, 1865; last met December 30,
                    1868; abolished in 1893 and responsibility for publication was assigned to the
                    Library Committee. Publications eventually concerned only membership matters,
                    and eventually came under the stewardship of the Member Relations Committee.</p>
