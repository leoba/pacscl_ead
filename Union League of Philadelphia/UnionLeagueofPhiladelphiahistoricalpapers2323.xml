            <bioghist>
                <p>The Union League of Philadelphia was founded in 1862 as a patriotic society to
                    support the policies of President Abraham Lincoln. It evolved to its current
                    identity as a non-sectarian and non-partisan private club. Ferdinand J. Dreer
                    evidently collected photographs and autographs of Union Club members, and saved
                    Union Club meeting invitations and other memorabilia relating to the early years
                    of the Club. This material has been supplemented by additions from Boker's
                    invitations to the Club's annual dinners and other memorabilia together with
                    some later additions. The Military Committee of the Union League raised nine
                    regiments of infantry, five cavalry companies, and five regiments of U.S.
                    Colored Troops. From 1863 to 1865 the Union League sent Silver Medals in
                    appreciation of distinguished services and conferring privileges of
                    membership.</p>
