            <bioghist>
                <p>The Union League of Philadelphia was founded in 1862 as a patriotic society to
                    support the policies of President Abraham Lincoln. It evolved to its current
                    identity as a non-sectarian and non-partisan private club. In 1863 the Union
                    League purchased the property at Broad and Sansom (George) Streets. The Union
                    League building on Broad Street, designed by John Fraser and built by John
                    Crump, was officially opened in March 1865. From 1881 into the 1890s a series of
                    additions were made onto the west end, including what was called the Benson
                    Annex. The Advisory Real Estate Board was appointed by the Board in 1897 to
                    prepare a plan for the improvement of the property that had been acquired along
                    Sansom and Moravian Streets to 15th Street. A Building Committee was appointed
                    in 1905 to oversee design and construction of an addition, and its decisions
                    were sometimes subject to approval of the Advisory Real Estate Board (sometimes
                    not). By 1984 the Advisory Board was to "consider and report to the Board of
                    Directors upon such propositions relating to any building, rebuilding, or
                    improvement of the real property of the corporation, as the Board of Directors
                    shall have referred to them for consideration and report, but they shall not
                    expend any moneys of the corporation, nor enter into any contract binding upon
                    the corporation" (1984 By-laws). Its responsibilities overlapped with the High
                    Committee, which might refer recommendations to the Advisory Board. The Advisory
                    Board was eliminated in 1987.</p>
