            <bioghist>
                <p>The Board of Trustees of Villanova University is composed of between 20 and 30
                    members, at least nine of whom must be members in good standing of the Order of
                    Saint Augustine of the Province of Saint Thomas of Villanova. The Board of
                    Trustees has responsibility over all that pertains to the University. The
                    President and Vice Presidents of the University serve at the discretion of the
                    board. </p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of records of the Board of Trustees of Villanova University.
                    The materials consist of administrative records, correspondence, legal
                    documents, minutes, and reports. The bulk of the collection is made up of
                    minutes of the Board of Trustees, dating from 1848 to 2006 (early minutes are
                    present as photocopies). There are also summaries of Board meetings from 1972 to
                    1997. Administrative records include lists of Trustees by class (1975-1987);
                    committee memberships (1974-1985); board resolutions (1920-1938); drawings and
                    descriptions of the University's coat of arms and seal and a description of the
                    mace; and a copy of the investment policy for Villanova Endowment Funds, 1982.
                    Correspondence and legal documents relate to Villanova's status as a University;
                    the legal materials also include information on University service marks and the
                    Board of Trustees' charter and by-laws, amendments, and decrees, 1848-1985
                    (materials from the 19th century are present as typed copies made at a later
                    date). Finally, the collection includes general financial reports and statements
                    (1951-2000) and reports of receipts and disbursements for the Villanovan
                    (1948-1967) and Belle Air (1948-1967).</p>
