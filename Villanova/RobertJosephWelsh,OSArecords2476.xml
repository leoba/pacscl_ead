            <bioghist>
                <p>Father Robert Joseph Welsh (1921-1992) was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He
                    graduated from Villanova in 1943 with an A.B. degree and began his study of
                    theology at Augustinian College in Washington, D.C. During the summer months he
                    took graduate courses in English at the nearby Catholic University of America.
                    In 1947 he was ordained to the priesthood. Following ordination, he was sent to
                    Collegio Santa Monica, in Rome, Italy, where he earned his S.T.L. and S.T.D.
                    degrees. Father Welshâ€™s first assignment was to Augustinian College in
                    Washington, D.C., where from 1950-1956 he taught moral theology and was
                    Sub-master of Professed. In 1956 he was transferred to Villanova University,
                    where he taught in the department of theology. From 1956 to 1959 he also served
                    as Secretary of the Province of Saint Thomas of Villanova. In 1960 he was
                    appointed Assistant Dean of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and the following year
                    became Dean. In 1967 Father Welsh became the 28th president of Villanova
                    University, a position he held until 1971. In 1971 he was named prior of
                    Augustinian College in Washington, D.C., and was chosen to serve at the same
                    time as President of the Washington Theological Union. In 1975 he was elected to
                    the Council of the Province of Saint Thomas of Villanova where he served as
                    Province Director of Education until 1979. From 1980 to 1984 he brought his
                    wealth of experience to Malvern Preparatory School, Malvern, Pennsylvania,
                    becoming there a popular and respected guidance counselor. In 1985 Father Welsh
                    was named treasurer of the Province of Saint Thomas of Villanova and held that
                    position until 1988. In that year he was named Assistant to the President of
                    Villanova University, a position he continued to hold even as his health began
                    to fail. During his active years in the education apostolate, Father Welsh
                    served on the Boards of Trustees of Villanova University, of Merrimack College
                    in North Andover, Massachusetts, and of Malvern Preparatory School. A building
                    on the West Campus of Villanova University has been named in his honor.</p>
