            <bioghist>
                <p>Bishop Thomas Galberry (1833-1878) was born in County Kildare, Ireland. He
                    entered the Augustinian novitiate at Villanova, Pennsylvania, in 1852. His
                    ordination to the priesthood by Bishop John Neumann of Philadelphia took place
                    in 1856. After his ordination, he served on the mission of Saint Denis’ in
                    Ardmore, Pennsylvania, and Saint Augustine’s in Lansingburg (Troy), New York.
                    Later he served as Prior of Saint Thomas of Villanova Monastery and President of
                    Villanova College from 1872-1876. During this time, the west wing of Alumni Hall
                    was added to the original building. Father Galberrry’s next assignment was as
                    Commissary-General of the Vice Province in America, and, when it became a
                    Province, he was elected its first Provincial. In 1876, he was consecrated the
                    fourth Bishop of Hartford, Connecticut. Bishop Galberry was on his way to
                    Villanova College from Hartford when he died in New York City on 10 October
                    1878, at the age of 45. He was buried in the Cathedral of Hartford, Connecticut.
                    The Graphic Services building on Villanova University campus is named in his
                    honor.</p>
