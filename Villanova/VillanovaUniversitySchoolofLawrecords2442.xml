            <bioghist>
                <p>The idea for a law school at Villanova first surfaced in the 1920s, but was not
                    realized until the physical expansion that took place at the University after
                    World War II. In 1953, under the presidency of Father Francis X. N. McGuire,
                    Eugene Lester Garey, a prominent New York lawyer, bequeathed to the University
                    $1.2 million to establish a new law school. Harold Gill Reuschlein was appointed
                    the first dean and, in 1957, Garey Hall was opened and dedicated. The Law School
                    was the first law school under Catholic auspices to be awarded a chapter of the
                    Order of Coif, a national honor society devoted to the encouragement of high
                    standards of legal scholarship, with chapters in leading schools of law
                    throughout the country.</p>
