            <bioghist>
                <p>Reverend James Joseph Dean (1879-1964) studied at Villanova and went on to do
                    graduate work at University of Pennsylvania. He was ordained to the priesthood
                    on 29 September 1901. For twenty-five years he was a member of the Villanova
                    faculty, teaching mathematics. He served as president of the University from
                    1917 to 1920. Father Father Dean was an able orator, and during World War I this
                    talent of his was drawn upon for Liberty Loan drives and other patriotic
                    celebrations. In October 1919 Governor Sproul appointed Father Dean a member of
                    the State College and University Council, which passes on charters of
                    incorporation for educational institutions. Father Dean was the first Catholic
                    college president ever appointed to this council.</p>

                <p>This is a small collection of papers of Father James Joseph Dean. Materials
                    consist of one folder of correspondence related to academic accreditation,
                    1918-1919. The letters are notifications of accreditation of programs; one
                    letter indicates that the Engineering School has been accredited by the
                    Secretary of War.</p>
