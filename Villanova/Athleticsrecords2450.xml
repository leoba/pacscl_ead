                    auspices of the Athletic Department. Villanova is a member of the Big East

                <p>This is a collection of records of the Director of Athletics of Villanova
                    University and the Varsity Sports program. The collection documents Villanovaâ€™s
                    football, basketball, and baseball programs, with a smaller number of items
                    relating to track and cross country, swimming and diving, crew, field hockey,
                    golf, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, volleyball, water polo,
                    and wrestling. The bulk of the items in the collection are printed materials,
                    news clippings, and reports. Types of materials include calendars and schedules,
                    handbooks, programs, departmental reports, score books, tickets, and media
                    guides. Of note are approximately thirty scrapbooks of news clippings about
                    Villanova football (1933-1955); basketball (1933-1956); track (1940-1956); and
                    other sports (1937-1965). There are also a small number of financial records,
                    departmental reports, and other administrative records of the Athletics program,
                    including a volume of financial records and clippings (1913-1922); addresses by
                    Francis X. Regan (1954-1959); several letters of past athletics directors;
                    correspondence related to the 1941 basketball "black list"; and a volume of
                    minutes of the Athletics Board (1927-1956).</p>
