            <bioghist>
                <p>Father James Griffin (1891-1972) graduated from Villanova College in 1912. After
                    graduation, he was sent to Saint Monica’s International College in Rome to study
                    theology. The onset of World War I called him home in 1915. He was ordained at
                    Villanova. From 1915 to 1926 Father Griffin served the parish of Our Mother of
                    Consolation in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In June 1926 he was
                    appointed president of Villanova College. In 1932 Father Griffin began a series
                    of pastorates in New York State: at Waterford, Jamaica, Staten Island and
                    Greenwich. He gained a widespread reputation throughout New York State as an
                    organizer working with the Saint Vincent De Paul Society and as a chaplain of
                    Queens General Hospital, New York. He was also noted for his work with
                    alcoholics and drug addicts. In 1968 he was appointed Prior at the Augustinian
                    Community at Saint Augustine’s, Lawrence, Massachusetts. </p>
