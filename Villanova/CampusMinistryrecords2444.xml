            <bioghist>
                <p>Villanova University traces its origins to old Saint Augustine's Church in
                    Philadelphia, which the Augustinians founded in 1796, and to its parish school,
                    Saint Augustine's Academy, established in 1811. Villanova University has been
                    sponsored by the Augustinian Order since its founding in 1842. Reflecting
                    traditions of Roman Catholic and Augustinian spirituality, Villanova's Campus
                    Ministry engages in every aspect of University life through prayer, liturgy,
                    community service, and pastoral care. </p>
