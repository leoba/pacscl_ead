            <bioghist>
                <p>Father Francis Xavier McGuire (1909-2003) graduated from Villanova College in
                    1932. After graduation, he studied theology at the Gregorian University in Rome,
                    was ordained to the priesthood in Rome in 1935, and earned his Doctorate of
                    Divinity in 1939. That same year, he began teaching theology at Villanova
                    College, and served as prefect of studies until 1941. During the Provincial
                    Chapter of 1941, Father McGuire was appointed vice president of Villanova
                    College and three years later, at age 34, became Villanova’s 24th president.
                    While president of Villanova from 1944 to 1954, Father McGuire oversaw the
                    transformation of Villanova College from a small liberal arts college to an
                    expanded institution of higher education, culminating in Villanova’s elevation
                    to University status in 1953. After leaving Villanova in 1954, Father McGuire
                    taught at Merrimack College, in North Andover, Massachusetts, before continuing
                    parochial ministries in parishes in Massachusetts and New York. His last active
                    assignment was prior of the Retreat House, formerly Augustinian Academy, Staten
                    Island, New York. He returned to Villanova in 1996, where he spent his remaining
                    years.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a collection of papers of Father Francis X. N. McGuire. The papers
                    consist of correspondence, legal documents, news media, personal papers, and
                    reports. The correspondence deals with academic accreditation, the National
                    College Athletic Association, the Eastern College Athletic Conference, and the
                    Division of Nursing. The NCAA materials relate to Villanova's qualifications
                    under the NCAA's "Sanity Code," which governed the amount and forms of
                    assistance offered to students on athletic scholarships. The legal documents
                    mainly relate to loan agreements and estates (1949-1954), including the Eugene
                    L. Garey estate. News media consists of newspaper clippings about Eugene L.
                    Garey and about the installation of Father McGuire as president of the
                    University. Personal papers include a sermon given by Father McGuire on the
                    death of the Very Rev. Mortimer Sullivan and a copy of the Congressional Record
                    in which is reprinted Father McGuire's sermon entitled “Peace and the Natural
                    Law." Reports in the collection include Father McGuire's curriculum vitae and a
                    report on development.</p>
