            <bioghist>
                <p>Father Christopher McEvoy (1840-1914) was born in Ireland. Before coming to
                    Villanova College in 1866, he attended Notre Dame University and Niagara
                    College. In 1868 he entered the novitiate at Villanova, Pennsylvania, and was
                    ordained to the priesthood in 1871. After ordination, Father McEvoy was
                    stationed at Our Mother of Consolation in Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, and in
                    1881 he opened the first parochial school there. From 1882 to 1890, he served as
                    Provincial of the Province of Saint Thomas of Villanova. Father McEvoy next
                    served at Villanova, where he was president of the College (1890-1894), Prior of
                    the Augustinian Community, and Pastor of Saint Thomas of Villanova Church. He
                    also served at Saint Denis’ in Ardmore, Pennsylvania; at Saint Augustine’s in
                    Philadelphia; and, again, at Our Mother of Consolation in Chestnut Hill,
                    Pennsylvania. Father McEvoy died at Villanova in 1914.</p>
