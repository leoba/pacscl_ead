            <bioghist>
                <p>Villanova University's College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is home to a number
                    of academic centers and institutes dedicated to promoting the mission of the
                    College within their area of concentration. In addition to offering courses,
                    centers and institutes, the College host lectures and other special events and
                    may publish a journal. The Center for Arab and Islamic Studies (originally
                    called the Institute for Contemporary Arab and Islamic Studies) was established
                    in 1983 to serve students who wish to specialize in Arab affairs and students
                    with a general interest in international affairs. The Institute sponsors an
                    undergraduate certificate program in Arab and Islamic studies, in conjunction
                    with a regular major. As a scholarly forum, the Institute organizes conferences,
                    lectures, and cultural events.</p>
