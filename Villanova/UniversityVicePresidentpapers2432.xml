                <p>Villanova University traces its origins to old Saint Augustine's Church in
                    Philadelphia, which the Augustinians founded in 1796, and to its parish school,
                    Saint Augustine's Academy, established in 1811. Villanova University has been
                    sponsored by the Augustinian Order since its founding in 1842. Today, the
                    University is comprised of five colleges: Liberal Arts and Sciences (Villanova
                    College), Engineering, School of Business (formerly known as the College of
                    Commerce and Finance), Nursing and the School of Law.</p>

                <p>The Vice President record group consists of the following series: Multicultural
                    Affairs, Office of Planning, Training and Institutional Research (OPTIR), and
                    University Information Technologies (UNIT). Materials related to multicultural
                    affairs include correspondence, printed materials, and reports. The records of
                    the Office of Planning, Training and Institutional Research consist of the
                    following sub-series: Administrative, Minutes, Programs, and Reports. The bulk
                    of the collection is made up of reports. Topics include student surveys,
                    organization plans and job descriptions, campus climate survey, strategic
                    planning for a number of academic and support departments, and a foundation
                    profile survey. Records in the the University Information Technologies (UNIT)
                    series include printed materials, reports, handbooks, and proposals for media
                    technology (1967-1998), including a 1970 computer user handbook and an annual
                    report on University Information Technologies, 1997-1998.</p>
