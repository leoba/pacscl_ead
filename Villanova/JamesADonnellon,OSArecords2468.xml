            <bioghist>
                <p>Father James Donnellon (1906-1971) graduated from Augustinian Academy, Staten
                    Island, in 1924 and from Villanova College in 1930. He pursued his theological
                    training in Washington, D.C. at Augustinian College, and the Catholic
                    University, and was ordained a priest in June 1932. Father Donnellon received an
                    M.S. and a Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1936 and
                    1938, respectively. He also did graduate studies at Harvard Medical School and
                    at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Father
                    Donnellon taught Biology at Villanova College, where he was also chairman of the
                    department at Fordham University. In 1954 he was named president of Villanova
                    College. In June 1959 he was elected Provincial of the Province of Saint Thomas
                    of Villanova and served in that capacity until 1965. He was then appointed Prior
                    of the Augustinian Monastery at Villanova.</p>
