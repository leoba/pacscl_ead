            <bioghist>
                <p>Villanova University has featured intercollegiate competition since 1866. NCAA
                    orientation visit took place in June 1995. This orientation visit as other
                    visits, for example, February 2002 was to initiate the process towards NCAA
                    Compliance Certification. The certification process is an opportunity to review,
                    reinforce and refine athletic offerings in all intercollegiate activities. The
                    purpose of certification is to ensure that the NCAAâ€™s commitment to integrity in
                    intercollegiate athletics is being upheld by member institutions. Villanova
                    concurs with the NCAA that a well-conducted self-study yields significant
                    benefits in self-awareness, affirmation and opportunities to improve. Villanova
                    had the opportunity to conduct a NCAA Certification Self-Study the first
                    beginning in late 1994 and the following in April 2003. In each of these
                    self-studies, Villanova included representatives from the Board of Trustees,
                    administration, faculty, staff, students and alumni/ae. These were the
                    constituents who served on the Steering Committee and Subcommittees and were
                    involved in the respective self-study. Various techniques in gathering data were
                    used in the process such as: interviews focus groups, survey and community
                    forums. NCAA guidelines, handbook and instrument were used in preparing all
                    self-studies.</p>
