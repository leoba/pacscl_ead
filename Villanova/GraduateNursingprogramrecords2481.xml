            <bioghist>
                <p>Villanova University's College of Nursing Graduate Nursing Program was
                    established in 1980. The focus of the program was the preparation of leaders in
                    nursing education and nursing administration. In 1993, Villanova was the first
                    in the country to offer a designated graduate track in Case Management. Between
                    1995 and 1998 three new advanced practice tracks were established for nurse
                    practitioners, adult, pediatric and geriatric, and in 1998, the College of
                    Nursing established a track for the preparation of nurse anesthetists. In 1999,
                    the College of Nursing joined forces with the College of Commerce and Finance to
                    develop a joint Health Care Administration track, and in 2004 the College
                    initiated its Ph.D. program.</p>
