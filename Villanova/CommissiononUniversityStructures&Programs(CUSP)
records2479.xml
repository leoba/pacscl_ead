            <bioghist>
                <p>The Commission on University Structures and Programs (CUSP) was formed by
                    Villanova University President Edward McCarthy in 1973 to examine all activities
                    of the University, both academic and non-academic, and to make recommendations
                    to the President and the Board of Trustees concerning steps that might be taken
                    to strengthen the University academically and financially. The Commission was
                    made up of nine faculty members, three students, and six administrators, with
                    every College and School being represented. The analysis included
                    self-evaluations, evaluation reports from accrediting agencies, and evaluations
                    by consultants from off-campus. The Report of the Commission on University
                    Structures and Programs was submitted to President John M. Driscoll in February
                    1977.</p>
