            <bioghist>
                <p>The Villanova University Senate is the Universityâ€™s formal legislative body whose
                    purpose is to effect greater participation in the decision-making processes of
                    Villanova for faculty members, students, administrators, and alumni. In 1969,
                    Rev. Robert J. Welsh, O.S.A., S.T.D., University President, was instrumental in
                    promoting the idea of the Villanova University Senate. The University Senate has
                    authority to legislate in numerous matters and it may recommend standards for
                    faculty compensation, fringe benefits, faculty social and working conditions,
                    and faculty duties and obligations to the University. It may also express
                    general opinion on any matter of faculty concern. Faculty members serve on the
                    following Senate committees: the Executive Committee, the Academic Policy
                    Committee, the Athletic Advisory Committee, the Budget Committee, the Committee
                    on Faculty, the Rules and Review Committee, the Committee on Mission and Social
                    Justice, the Student Life/Student Government Committee, and the University
                    Planning and Priorities Committee.</p>
