            <bioghist>
                <p>Villanova University traces its origins to old Saint Augustine's Church in
                    Philadelphia, which the Augustinians founded in 1796, and to its parish school,
                    Saint Augustine's Academy, established in 1811. Villanova University has been
                    sponsored by the Augustinian Order since its founding in 1842. Today, the
                    University is comprised of five colleges: Liberal Arts and Sciences (Villanova
                    College), Engineering, School of Business (formerly known as the College of
                    Commerce and Finance), Nursing and the School of Law. Institutional Advancement
                    at Villanova is responsible for a range of activities which provide the
                    framework for building strong support and lasting relationships with a variety
                    of University constituencies, including alumni, parents, friends, and members of
                    the community.</p>
