            <bioghist>
                <p>Villanova University traces its origins to old Saint Augustine's Church in
                    Philadelphia, which the Augustinians founded in 1796, and to its parish school,
                    Saint Augustine's Academy, established in 1811. Villanova University has been
                    sponsored by the Augustinian Order since its founding in 1842. Today, the
                    University is comprised of five colleges: Liberal Arts and Sciences (Villanova
                    College), Engineering, School of Business (formerly known as the College of
                    Commerce and Finance), Nursing and the School of Law.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>Papers of the Vice President for Finance and Administration are grouped into four
                    series: Administrative, Correspondence, Legal, and Reports. Administrative
                    records include: financial forms; budgets and ledgers of expenditures; an
                    inventory of the barn (destroyed by fire in 1916); information on insurance and
                    risk management; proposals, contracts, payment schedules for the building of
                    Stanford Hall, Kennedy Hall, and the science building; and receipts for taxes,
                    water, and sewer connections. Correspondence dates from 1940 to 1971, and
                    relates largely to properties, loan funds, utilities contracts, and financial
                    aid. Legal records relate largely to estates, facilities, and insurance.
                    Finally, the collection includes reports of Ford Foundation grants, annual
                    planning, and blueprints of the Steam Plant. The collection also includes
                    various printed materials, including handbooks for professional librarians,
                    part-time employees, and retirement plan brochures. Volumes in the collection
                    include: lists of students (1854-1855), student accounts and fees, college
                    receipts and expenditures (1854-1856); student expenses (1850-1875); auditors
                    reports (1936-1942); and other financial records.</p>
