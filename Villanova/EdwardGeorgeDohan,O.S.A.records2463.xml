            <bioghist>
                <p>Father Edward George Dohan (1870-1936) was born in Troy, New York. He entered the
                    Augustinian novitiate at Villanova, Pennsylvania, in 1895, and was ordained in
                    1899. He was stationed on Staten Island, New York, until 1906 when he became
                    pastor of the newly established church of Saint Nicholas of Tolentine in the
                    Bronx, New York. Father Dohan was appointed president of Villanova College in
                    1910 and held that position until 1917, after which he became Rector of Saint
                    Josephâ€™s in Greenwich, New York. From 1920 to 1926, he was in charge of Our
                    Mother of Good Counsel parish, and of the Augustinian Academy, on Staten Island,
                    New York. Father Dohan thus became the first Rector of the Academy, (school for
                    Augustinian Postulants) when it was moved from Villanova to Staten Island. He
                    also remained its first Rector when it was moved from Austin Place to Grimes
                    Hill on Staten Island. Later he served at Greenwich and Troy, New York.</p>

                <p>The Edward G. Dohan papers is a very small collection consisting of
                    correspondence, news media, and documents related to a 1911 Engineering
                    scholarship competition. The correspondence deals with academic accreditation.
                    Newspaper clippings include articles on Father Edward G. Dohan's installation as
                    the president of the College and one article on the Villanova Association.
                    Documentation of the Engineering scholarship includes a letter from Father Dohan
                    outlining the program, a postcard announcement of the scholarship, lists of
                    geometry, physics, trigonometry, and algebra problems, and two forms related to
                    the competition. </p>
