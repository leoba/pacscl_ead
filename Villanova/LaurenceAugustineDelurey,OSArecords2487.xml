            <bioghist>
                <p>Father Laurence Delurey (1864-1922) was born in Easton, New York. He entered the
                    Augustinian novitiate at Villanova, Pennsylvania, in 1885, and was ordained to
                    the priesthood in 1890. He served for a short time at Saint Nicholas of
                    Tolentine in New York City before being transferred to Saint Augustine’s in
                    Havana, Cuba. After becoming, first, procurator and then vice president at
                    Villanova College, he served as president there from 1895 to 1910. In 1905,
                    during his presidency, the inauguration of the engineering school was announced.
                    Father Delurey died in 1922 at the age of 58. Delurey Hall, a residence hall on
                    the Villanova University campus, is named in his honor.</p>

                <p>The Laurence A. Delurey Papers consist of a printed booklet of tributes for the
                    occasion of Father Delurey's receiving his doctorate and a program for the
                    reception given by faculty and students at that time. The collection also
                    includes an article entitled “Manifold Benefits of Student Athletics" by the
