            <bioghist>
                <p>Father Thomas Cooke Middleton (1842-1923) was born in Chestnut Hill,
                    Pennsylvania, to a Quaker family. He was baptized at the age of 12 with his
                    entire family. He entered the Augustinian novitiate at Tolentine, Italy, in
                    1858, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1864. In 1865, Father Middleton
                    returned to the United States and Villanova College, where he served and lived
                    for the next 58 years. At Villanova College he was a teacher, Prefect of Studies
                    of the College, Archivist, and Secretary and Socius of the Province. He also
                    served as president of Villanova College from 1876 to 1878 and College Librarian
                    from 1865 to 1923. In 1884, Father Middleton helped organize the American
                    Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia, of which he was the first
                    President. He was the author of many essays on local Catholic history and the
                    history of the Order of Saint Augustine, including the Introduction to the
                    Oratorian translations of Life of Saint Thomas of Villanova. He also prepared an
                    historical sketch of Villanova College which was published in 1893, the year of
                    the College's 50th anniversary. Middleton Hall, the Health Center at Villanova
                    University, is named in his honor.</p>
