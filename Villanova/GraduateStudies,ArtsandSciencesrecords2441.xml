            <bioghist>
                <p>Villanova University traces its origins to old Saint Augustine's Church in
                    Philadelphia, which the Augustinians founded in 1796, and to its parish school,
                    Saint Augustine's Academy, established in 1811. Villanova University has been
                    sponsored by the Augustinian Order since its founding in 1842. Today, the
                    University is comprised of five colleges: Liberal Arts and Sciences (Villanova
                    College), Engineering, School of Business (formerly known as the College of
                    Commerce and Finance), Nursing and the School of Law. The Graduate Studies
                    Program of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences offers over 50 programs,
                    from master's degrees to pre- and post-master's certificates, and a Ph.D. in
                    Philosophy.</p>

                    minutes, printed materials, and reports. Administrative records include teacher
                    evaluation questionnaires, graduate enrollment statistics, and a 1967-1968

                    graduate school. Minutes are present for meetings of Graduate Council and other
                    committees involved in graduate studies. Printed materials include brochures and
                    directories. Reports include degrees awarded, graduate enrollment statistics,
                    and self-evaluations of the Graduate School.</p>
