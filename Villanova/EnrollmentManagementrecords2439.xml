            <bioghist>
                <p>Villanova University traces its origins to old Saint Augustine's Church in
                    Philadelphia, which the Augustinians founded in 1796, and to its parish school,
                    Saint Augustine's Academy, established in 1811. Villanova University has been
                    sponsored by the Augustinian Order since its founding in 1842. Today, the
                    University is comprised of five colleges: Liberal Arts and Sciences (Villanova
                    College), Engineering, School of Business (formerly known as the College of
                    Commerce and Finance), Nursing and the School of Law. Enrollment Management is
                    the administrative area of the University that includes the Offices of
                    University Admission, Financial Assistance and Registrar.</p>

                    the Part Time Studies program. Admissions department files include a list of
                    students and teachers (1843-1895); lists of students (1895-1896 and 1902-1912);
                    student grades (1882-1895); freshman bulletins (1971-1987); annual reports of
                    the Admissions department from the 1990s; and a manual of procedures for the
                    department. Registrar's files include registration forms; class schedules
                    (1800s, 1920); examination schedules (1950-1954); lists of religious affiliation

                    procedures; news clippings about the program; and reports of enrollment
                    statistics. The collection also includes a nearly complete run of commencement
