            <bioghist>
                <p>Robert Abbe (1851-1928) was an American surgeon and pioneering radiologist in New
                    York City. He received his S.B. from the College of the City of New York in 1871
                    and his M.D. from Columbia University in 1874. In 1904, after corresponding with
                    Marie and Pierre Curie about their research on radiation, he visited their
                    laboratories in Paris. Abbe returned to the United States with samples and began
                    experimental therapies for cancer treatment. Today, he is known as the founder
                    of radiation therapy in the United States. Abbe suffered from a rare form of
                    anemia toward the end of his life that may have been the result of exposure to
                    radiation. He was a Fellow of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. Truman
                    Abbe (1873-1955), nephew of Robert Abbe, was born in Washington, D. C. and
                    graduated from Harvard University in 1895. He received his degree in medicine at
                    Columbia University in 1899, and then pursued post-graduate studies at the
                    University of Berlin. Abbe began work in 1902 at Georgetown University and was
                    appointed instructor there in 1905. In 1907, he was awarded a silver medal at
                    the Jamestown Exposition for his research on the uses of radium in medicine.</p>
