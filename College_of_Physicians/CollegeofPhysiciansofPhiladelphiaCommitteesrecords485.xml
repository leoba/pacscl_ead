            <bioghist>
                <p>The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, founded in 1787, is the oldest
                    professional medical organization in the country. The College is home to the
                    MÃ¼tter Museum and the Historical Medical Library. Through its program of
                    lectures, workshops, and conferences, as well as through the C. Everett Koop
                    Community Education Center and PhillyHealthInfo.org, an online health
                    information resource, the College provides a place for both medical
                    professionals and the general public to learn about medicine as both a science
                    and as an art. Much of the work of the College is accomplished by various
                    standing and pro-tem committees. Standing committees include the Library,
                    Finance, Building, Publications, Fellowship, Women's, Nominations, Ordinances
                    and By-Laws, and Mutter Museum and College Collections Committees.</p>
