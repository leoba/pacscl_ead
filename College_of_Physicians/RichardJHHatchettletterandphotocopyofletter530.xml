            <bioghist>
                <p>Richard Jones Haynie Hatchett (1814-1895) was born in Lunenburg County, Virginia.
                    He received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1835. He
                    worked for 40 years in a country practice. He was married to Sarah Jane Wilson
                    in 1840 and they had eight children. He died in Durham, North Carolina, in
                    1895.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>A three-page letter, written in pencil by Hatchett, presumably to a classmate
                    from the University of Pennsylvania class of 1835. The letter thanks the
                    recipient for his vindication of the sender's ideas on bloodletting, leeching,
                    and cupping, which other physicians have disdained. He suggests that the
                    recipient read his article, published in the Virginia Medical Monthly, which was
                    also extracted in the Analectic of New York. The collection also includes a
                    recent photocopy of the letter.</p>
