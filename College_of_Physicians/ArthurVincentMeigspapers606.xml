            <bioghist>
                <p>Arthur Vincent Meigs (1850-1912) was the son and grandson of the physicians, J.
                    Forsyth Meigs and Charles D. Meigs. After studying at the University of
                    Pennsylvania for two years, he entered its medical school, receiving the M.D.
                    degree in 1871. He spent the next two years in Vienna. Upon his return to
                    Philadelphia, he established a medical practice which he continued until his
                    death. He was attending physician at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital, Pennsylvania
                    Hospital, and the Sheltering Arms (a home for foundlings) and consulting
                    physician at the Eastern State Penitentiary and the Pennsylvania Institute for
                    the Instruction of the Blind. He was a fellow of the College of Physicians and
                    its president from 1904 to 1907. He was president of the Philadelphia
                    Pathological Society, a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania and of the
                    Wistar Institute, and a member of the American Philosophical Society. His
                    scientific work on the comparative chemistry of the milk of humans and cows was
                    begun in the 1880s, when he published a treatise, Milk Analysis and Infant
                    Feeding, and was continued until about 1908, when he worked in the Hare
                    Laboratory of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
