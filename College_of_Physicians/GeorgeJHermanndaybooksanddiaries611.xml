            <bioghist>
                <p>Dr. George Joseph Hermann Sr. (1873-1933) was born in Newport, Kentucky. He
                    graduated from the Medical College of Ohio in 1891 and began his practice in
                    Newport in 1895. He purchased the first fluoroscopic x-ray machine in Northern
                    Kentucky in 1914. </p>

                <p>The first volume includes lecture notes from courses at Medical College of Ohio,
                    beginning in 1892, and several pages of prescriptions for ointments, medicines,
                    and other concoctions. The remainder of the volume contains diary entries about
                    Hermann's professional and personal activities. The second volume is a diary and
