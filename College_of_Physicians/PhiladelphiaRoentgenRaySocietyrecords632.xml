            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Roentgen Ray Society was organized by Charles Lester Leonard as
                    the Roentgen Society of Philadelphia on 2 Feb. 1905. Its objects were to study
                    X-rays and promote professional contact. After Leonard's death, the society was
                    reorganized and became the Philadelphia Roentgen Ray Society on 1 Dec. 1913. Its
                    officers include a president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer. The
                    society was incorporated in 1929.</p>
