                <p>The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, founded in 1787, is the oldest
                    professional medical organization in the country. The College is home to the
                    MÃ¼tter Museum, the Historical Medical Library, the C. Everett Koop Community
                    Education Center, and PhillyHealthInfo.org. Beginning in 1893, with the
                    establishment of the Section on Ophthalmology, Fellows of the College began to
                    organize discipline- and practice-specific working groups. Other Sections
                    include Basic Science, Dermatology, Gynecology, Internal Medicine, Medical
                    History, Orthopedic Surgery, Otology and Laryngology, Public Health, Surgery,
                    and the Blockley Section.</p>
