                    McGill University in Montreal in 1872. Following postgraduate training in
                    Europe, Osler returned to McGill University as a professor in 1874. In 1884 he

                    Philadelphia. Osler became the first chief of staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital in
                    1889, and in 1893 one of the first professors of medicine at Johns Hopkins
