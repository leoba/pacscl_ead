            <bioghist>
                <p>The University of Pennsylvania Hospital was created in the 1870s as a teaching
                    hospital staffed by the University's medical faculty. As such, it was the first
                    teaching hospital built for a medical school. During the late nineteenth and
                    early twentieth centuries, the School of Medicine encouraged the development of
                    emerging medical specialties such as neurosurgery, ophthalmology, dermatology,
                    and radiology. In the early decades of the twentieth century, the hospital
                    created a bedside teaching program in response to the reformist Flexner Report
                    (1910).</p>
