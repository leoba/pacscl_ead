            <bioghist>
                <p>Zachary Friedenberg served in Italy as a military surgeon during World War II. He
                    worked at the 95th Evacuation Hospital, which was called upon to support the
                    Anzio invasion after prior service in North Africa and Southern Italy. The
                    hospital was struck by aerial bombs, with many casualties, and replaced by
                    another hospital in Anzio, while the remaining personnel were returned to
                    Naples.</p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection consists primarily of photocopies of reports, statistical
                    summaries and charts, and personnel lists and photographs from the 95th
                    Evacuation Hospital in Italy, France, and Germany. Includes surgical,
                    anesthesia, nursing, and medical service reports for 1944 and 1945 and yearly
                    historical reports for the years 1943 and 1944. The collection also includes a
                    copy of a six-page letter written by Zachary Friedenberg between Jan 21 and 29
                    of 1944. A manuscript letter was sent to Friedenberg's parents, who typed it and
                    sent a copy to his uncle. This is a photocopy of the typed version of the
                    letter. The letter recalls Friedenberg's experiences prior to and during the
                    Allied invasion of Anzio, Italy.</p>
