            <bioghist>
                <p>Elm Hill Private School and Home for the Education of Feeble-Minded Youth was
                    founded in 1848 in Barre, Massachusetts, by physician Hervey Backus Wilbur
                    (1820-1883). Wilbur was heavily influenced by the ideas of Edward Seguin
                    (1812-1880), who believed in the instructability of the feeble-minded.
                    Originally called the Institution for the Education of Idiots, Imbeciles, and
                    Children of Retarded Development of Mind, Elm Hill was the first institution of
                    its kind in the United States. Set in bucolic central Massachusetts, Elm Hill
                    put Seguin's ideas, most completely put forth in his book Traitement moral,
                    hygienne, et education des idiots, into practice. Wilbur left Elm Hill in 1851
                    to establish a similar but state-sponsored school in New York.</p>

                    household maintenance, furniture repair, insurance, dental care), largely for
                    Elm Hill, but also some personal expenses of members of the Brown family.
                    Printed material includes reports from a variety of state-run and private
                    institutions and organizations (1870s-1930s); duplicate copies of the 23rd and
                    26th biennial report of the Private Institute for the Education of Feeble Minded
