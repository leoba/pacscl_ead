            <bioghist>
                <p>Ernest Adolf Spiegel, neurologist, was born in Vienna, in 1895. He married Mona
                    Spiegel-Adolf in 1925. Spiegel died in 1985. Spiegel received his M.D. from the
                    University of Vienna in 1918. From 1924 to 1930, he was a docent in anatomy and
                    the physiology of the nervous system at the University. In 1930, Spiegel joined
                    the staff of Temple University in Philadelphia, becoming Professor of
                    Experimental and Applied Neurology and head of the Department of Experimental
                    Neurology. He edited Confinia Neurologica and Progress in Neurology and
                    Psychiatry. In the 1960s, Spiegel and his wife both were associated with the
                    National Parkinson Institute, investigating inexpensive treatments for the
                    disease using dopamine. Ernest A. Spiegel was known for developing the use of
                    guided electrodes into the brain to treat involuntary movements, intractable
                    pain, emotional disorders, and brain tumors.</p>
