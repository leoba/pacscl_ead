            <bioghist>
                <p>The Hemlock Society was founded in 1980 as an end-of-life care organization for
                    those suffering with incurable illnesses. in 2003, the Society, after surveying
                    its membership, enhanced its mission to include a more proactive effort in
                    introducing and changing laws that allow people the right to choose a peaceful
                    hastened death if they are terminally ill and mentally competent. As a result of
                    this, the board of directors changed the society's name to End-of-Life
                    Choices.</p>
