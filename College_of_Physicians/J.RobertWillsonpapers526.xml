                    Willson earned his M.D. from the University of Michigan in 1937 and completed
                    his internship and residency in obstetrics and gynecology in 1942. He also held
                    an M.S. in obstetrics and gynecology. He left the University in 1942 for a
                    teaching position at Chicago Lying-In Hospital. He moved to Temple University
                    School of Medicine in 1946 as a professor and chair of its OB/GYN department.
