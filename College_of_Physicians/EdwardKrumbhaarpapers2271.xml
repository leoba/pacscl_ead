                    physiologist, as well as one of Philadelphia’s leading historians of medicine. A
                    founder of both the Section on Medical History of the College of Physicians and
                    the American Association of the History of Medicine (AAHM), Krumbhaar also
                    served as President of the College and of the AAHM. Throughout his career he
                    published English translations of works originally in French, German and
                    Italian. Besides his own work, he is best remembered by historians for his
                    revised translation of Arturo Castiglioni’s History of Medicine (1941).</p>
