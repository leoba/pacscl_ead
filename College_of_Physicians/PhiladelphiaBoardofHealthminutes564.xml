            <bioghist>
                <p>In 1793 Philadelphia was swept by an epidemic of yellow fever. A Board of Health,
                    with Dr. Benjamin Rush as a member, was created to counter the plague and
                    monitor sanitary conditions within the city. The Board of Health employed
                    inspectors to monitor and eliminate potential health hazards. Beginning in 1818,
                    Board of Health members were elected by the City Council and the Commissioners
                    of the Districts and Townships. By 1855, the Board was clearly designated a
                    branch of the City Government.</p>
