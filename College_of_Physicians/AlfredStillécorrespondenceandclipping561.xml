            <bioghist>
                <p>Alfred Stillé (1813-1900) entered Yale College in 1828, and left after his
                    sophomore year to attend the University of Pennsylvania. Stillé graduated with
                    an A.B. degree in 1832 and a M.D. degree in 1836. Stillé completed his medical
                    education in Paris under Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis. After his return from
                    Europe, Stillé served as a resident physician at Pennsylvania Hospital from 1839
                    to 1841. In 1849, Stillé was appointed visiting physician at St. Joseph's
                    Hospital and, from 1854 to 1859, as professor of the theory and practice of
                    medicine at the medical department of Pennsylvania Medical College. In 1864 he
                    became professor of theory and practice of medicine at the University of
                    Pennsylvania, a post he held until 1884. He was a founder and president of the
                    Philadelphia Pathological Society, president of the Philadelphia County Medical
                    Society, president of the College of Physicians (1883-1884) and a founder, first
                    secretary, and president of the American Medical Association.</p>
