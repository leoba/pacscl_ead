                <p>Evelyn Cook Bauerly (Mrs. Gordon Bauerly) majored in chemistry and biology at
                    Ursinus College, graduating in 1930. She worked for Benjamin Gruskin in his lab
                    at Temple Medical School. The lab was funded by the Lake Land College Foundation
                    of Chicago, and reports were sent to Mr. Harbison and Mr. Hubacheck at the
                    foundation. Gruskin was a scientist at Temple University. He was born in Vilno,
                    Lithuania and emigrated to the U.S. [date unknown]. He did graduate work at
                    Loyola University in Illinois. He studied the therapeutic use of chlorophyll in
                    medicine and dentistry.</p>
