            <bioghist>
                <p>Theodore Englar Woodward (1914-2005) was a physician and a professor at the
                    University of Maryland School of Medicine. Woodward was nominated for a Nobel
                    Prize for his role in finding cures for typhus and typhoid fever. During World
                    War II, he was assigned to the Army's School of Tropical Medicine combating
                    typhus epidemics, and after the war he worked at Walter Reed Army Medical
                    Center, where he did research on antibiotics. In 1948 he joined the University
                    of Maryland as associate professor of medicine. He was named chairman of the
                    Department of Medicine in 1954, a position he held until his retirement in
                    1981.</p>
