            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Orthopaedic Hospital was established in 1867. In 1870, an
                    Infirmary for Nervous Diseases was added. The hospital was established to treat
                    patients with bodily deformities or diseases of the nervous system. It accepted
                    charity and paying patients and also treated, at daily clinics, patients not
                    requiring admission. The hospital opened at 15 South 9th Street, and later moved
                    to the northwest corner of 17th and Summer streets. In 1938, the Philadelphia
                    Orthopaedic Hospital and Infirmary for Nervous Diseases merged with the
                    University of Pennsylvania and became part of the University Hospital. After the
                    merger, the 17th and Summer streets facility was assumed by the Doctors'
                    Hospital.</p>
