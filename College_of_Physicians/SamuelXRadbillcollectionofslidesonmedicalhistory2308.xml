            <bioghist>
                <p>Samuel X Radbill, Philadelphia pediatrician and medical historian, was born in
                    1901. Radbill received his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1924. In
                    1925, he became a Resident at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. In 1926,
                    Radbill opened his private practice. He began to specialize in pediatrics in
                    1938 and joined the pediatrics staff at Philadelphia General Hospital. During
                    the early 1930s, Radbill helped organize and run three free local pediatric
                    clinics in Philadelphia. During World War II, he served as an examiner for the
                    local draft board, then enlisted in 1942. He served as Chief of the Communicable
                    Disease Section at Ashburn General Hospital in McKinney, Tex., and Chief of
                    Medical Service and Venereal Disease Control Officer at Fort Crockett,
                    Galveston, Tex. Radbill was elected to fellowship in the College of Physicians
                    of Philadelphia in 1943. He died in 1987.</p>
