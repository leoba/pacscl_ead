            <bioghist>
                <p>The Obstetrical Society of Philadelphia was organized in Philadelphia on 6 June
                    1868 at the instigation of Albert Holmes Smith. Its objects were to advance the
                    study of obstetrics and the diseases of women and children through case
                    presentations, discussions, and publication. The society was incorporated on 14
                    April 1877. The officers of the society are a president, president-elect,
                    immediate past president, vice-president, secretary, assistant secretary, and
                    treasurer. The business affairs of the society are administered by its Council,
                    composed of the officers and four other members. There are, currently, five
                    categories of membership: active, associate, life, honorary, and inactive. There
                    was also, historically, another category, corresponding membership, for
                    physicians outside the Delaware Valley but within the United States.</p>
