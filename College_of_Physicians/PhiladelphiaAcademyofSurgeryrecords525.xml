            <bioghist>
                <p>The Philadelphia Academy of Surgery was organized by Samuel D. Gross on 21 Apr.
                    1879; it was incorporated in Dec. 1879. The academy was established to promote
                    surgical science through presentation of cases and specimens, discussions, and
                    publications. Original officers included a president, two vice-presidents,
                    recording and corresponding secretaries, a pathological histologist, and a
                    librarian. There was also a five-member Council. The academy's membership is
                    composed of resident, non-resident, corresponding, and honorary fellows. The
                    Academy's meetings are held at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. </p>
