            <bioghist>
                <p>David Y. Cooper (b. 1924) earned his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania
                    School of Medicine in 1948. After graduating, he was an intern at the Hospital
                    of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) for a year, where, from 1953 to 1957 he
                    was a resident in surgery. In 1959 he earned board certification in surgery, and
                    was appointed to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in the Harrison
                    Department of Surgical Research. He retired in 2004 after spending his entire
                    career at Penn, and was named Professor Emeritus. Dr. Cooper's most notable
                    contributions in the medical field include the discovery of the role of
                    cytochrome P-450, which is a series of enzymes found in the body.</p>
