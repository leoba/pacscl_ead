            <bioghist>
                <p>Merchant’s Gargling Oil was launched in 1833 by George W. Merchant, a pharmacist
                    of Lockport, New York. His Universal Family Embrocation was esteemed along the
                    Erie Canal where it was used to heal the bleeding sores of the horses and mules
                    that pulled the boats along the Canal. Word of mouth approval led to the
                    concoction then known as Merchant's Gargling Oil to be used as a liniment "for
                    man and beast". Merchant's formula was sold to M. H. Tucker in 1855. Merchant’s
                    Gargling Oil was still made in 1933, 100 years after its introduction.</p>
