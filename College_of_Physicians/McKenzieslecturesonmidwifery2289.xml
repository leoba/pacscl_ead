            <bioghist>
                <p>Dr. Colin Mackenzie was a pupil of the obstetrician William Smellie and later
                    taught midwifery in London from 1755 to 1772. </p>
            </bioghist>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This is a volume of manuscript lecture notes entitled "Lectures on the Theory
                    and Practice of Midwifery by Colin McKenzie, M.D." The notes appear to have
                    been taken by Isaac S. Thompson. There are 22 lectures; topics include "Of the
                    Structure of the Pelvis," "Of Conception and Touching," "On Abortion,"
                    "Premature Births," and "Preternatural Labor." The volume also includes
                    several recipes for prescriptions. The date of the volume is probably 1784.</p>
