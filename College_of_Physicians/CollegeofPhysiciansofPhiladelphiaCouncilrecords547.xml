            <bioghist>
                <p>The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, founded in 1787, is the oldest
                    professional medical organization in the country. The College is home to the
                    MÃ¼tter Museum and the Historical Medical Library. The Council of the College of
                    Physicians was established in 1863 to provide supervision over the affairs of
                    the College. The Council consists of officers of the College, chairmen of
                    standing committees, ex-presidents of the College, and the executive
                    director.</p>
