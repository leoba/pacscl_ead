            <bioghist>
                <p>Howard Childs Carpenter (1878-1955) received his M.D. from the University of
                    Pennsylvania Medical School in 1900. In 1914 Carpenter founded the Department
                    for the Prevention of Disease at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia. He was
                    appointed Professor of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of
                    Pennsylvania in 1929. He was a member of the Philadelphia Pediatric Society, the
                    Philadelphia County Medical Society, The American Pediatrics Society, and many
                    other societies and associations. Carpenter was elected a fellow of College of

            <scopecontent>
                <p>The collection contains approximately 250 glass lantern slides, measuring 3.25 x
                    4". Most of the slide are in black and white. The diverse images relate to
                    child healthcare, nutrition, and disease prevention. Subjects include: the
                    activities of the Department of Prevention of Disease; foreign children; infant
                    care; sanitary kitchens and farms; portraits of physicians; cartoons; and graphs
                    and diagrams. These slides probably accompanied lectures given by Carpenter to
                    community groups, mothers attending clinics at the Department for Prevention of
                    Diseases, and students attending the Pennsylvania School of Social and Health
                    Work.</p>
