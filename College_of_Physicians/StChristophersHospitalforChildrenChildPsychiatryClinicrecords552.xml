            <bioghist>
                <p>The Child Psychiatry Clinic was founded in 1936 at Temple University Medical
                    School. In 1952 the clinic moved from Temple Hospital to St. Christopher's
                    Hospital for Children. The Orthopedic Foundation helped fund this move and
                    continued to be involved in funding the clinic.</p>
