            <bioghist>
                <p>Dr. Charles Osgood introduced Osgood's India Cholagogue in 1830, and in the
                    following year wrote a sixteen page pamphlet, The Causes, Treatment, and Cure of
                    Fever and Ague, and other Diseases of Bilious Climates, to include with each
                    bottle. The article was first manufactured at Monroe, Michigan and later in
                    Norwich, Connecticut.</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of five letters from Charles Osgood to Benjamin Dansard,
                    who may have been a sales agent for Osgood in Monroe Michigan. The letters were
                    written between 1841 and 1849 and discuss business affairs between the two men,
                    including shipments of and payment for patent medicine, real estate in Monroe
                    owned by Osgood, and travel plans. The letters also discuss the general business
                    environment of Monroe.</p>
