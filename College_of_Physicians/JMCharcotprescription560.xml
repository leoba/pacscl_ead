            <bioghist>
                <p>Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) was born in Paris, France. He was a professor at
                    the University of Paris for 33 years. In 1862, he began an association with the
                    Salpetrière Hospital, eventually becoming director. His focus was neurology and
                    his work greatly influenced the developing fields of neurology and psychology.
                    He was called "the Napoleon of the neuroses". He was an influential teacher,
                    some of his more famous students being Sigmund Freud and Alfred Binet. He died
                    at Auberge des Settons, near Vézelay, France on August 16, 1893.</p>
