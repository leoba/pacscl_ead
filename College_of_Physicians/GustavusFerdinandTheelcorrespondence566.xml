                <p>Gustavus Ferdinand Theel received his M.D. from the Philadelphia University of
                    Medicine and Surgery in 1879. Theel offered diagnosis in person or through a
                    urine sample sent to him through the mail. He treated cases of "self-abuse,
                    gonorrhea, chancre, syphilis, lost manhood, etc."</p>

                <p>This is a collection of approximately 75 letters from patients addressed to
                    Professor Gustavus Ferdinand Theel written between 1899 and 1901. The letters
                    describe symptoms and request medicine for various physical and psychological
                    problems. Some of the letters have Theel's replies noted on them. Several of the
                    letters are from Theel, on his letterhead. The collection also includes two
                    completed patient questionnaires, with subsections for men and women.</p>
