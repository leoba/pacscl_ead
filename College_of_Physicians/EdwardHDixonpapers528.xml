            <bioghist>
                <p>Edward H. Dixon (1808-1880) was a prominent doctor in New York City in the
                    mid-19th century. He was a surgeon and a thorn in the side of the establishment
                    New York Academy of Medicine. According to the Academy he was "an able
                    practitioner but utterly devoid of accepted ethical principles." Dixon
                    published a journal, The Scalpel, to carry on his campaign against the Academy
                    and to entertain and instruct the public about medical practices.</p>
