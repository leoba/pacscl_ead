            <bioghist>
                <p>Isaac Starr (d. 1989) was a pioneering researcher and teacher in the field of
                    cardiovascular disease. Starr graduated from the University of Pennsylvania
                    School of Medicine in 1920. He was noted for his use of physics to measure the
                    efficiency of the heart and for his research on the physiology of congestive
                    heart failure. In 1939 he developed the first practical ballistocardiograph, an
                    instrument that measures the blood output of the heart and is used to predict
                    and measure the course of heart disease. He retired in 1961 but continued his
                    research until 1986. He received the Albert Lasker Award of the American Heart
                    Association in 1957, the Kober Medal of the Association of American Physicians
                    in 1967 and the Burger Medal of the Free University of Amsterdam in 1977.</p>

                <p>This is a collection primarily of laboratory notebooks relating to Starr's work
                    with the ballistocardiograph. Notebooks include lists and graphs of experiment
                    data, notes and calculations, patient information, typed summaries of
                    experiments, notes for papers and presentations, and correspondence with other
                    cardiologists and with medical records archivists. The collection also includes
                    a number of rolled ballistocardiograph printouts on photographic paper; printing
                    blocks for illustrations for articles; photographs of Starr in his laboratory;
                    instructions for performing tests; illustrations of equipment; and reprints
                    related to the history of cardiography.</p>
