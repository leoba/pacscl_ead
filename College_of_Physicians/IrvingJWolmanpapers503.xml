            <bioghist>
                <p>Irving J. Wolman (1905-1978) received his M.D. from Johns Hopkins in 1929. Wolman
                    was professor of pediatrics and hematologist at the Children's Hospital of
                    Philadelphia and head of the Department of Pediatrics in the University of
                    Pennsylvania’s Graduate Medical School. Wolman also served as Editor-in-Chief of
                    the medical journal Clinical Pediatrics. In the 1960s, Wolman became known for
                    his research into sickle cell anemia and Cooley’s anemia. He was also known for
                    his work in the 1940s proving the nutritional value of homogenized milk. Wolman
                    was elected in 1942 as a Fellow of the College of Physicians.</p>
