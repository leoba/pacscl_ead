            <bioghist>
                <p>George W. Brown was a graduate of the University of New York Medical Department.
                    He was the superintendent of the Elm Hill Private School and Home for the
                    Education of Feeble-Minded Youth. Never accepting more than 100 residents, and
                    remaining private, Elm Hill was run by the Brown family until it ceased
                    operation. George Artemas Brown (1858-1942),who graduated from the College of
                    Physicians and Surgeons of New York (later Columbia Medical School), was the
                    second Brown to become superintendent. George Artemasâ€™ son George Percy Brown
                    (1888-1971), who attended Yale and Harvard Medical School, was also a
                    superintendent. Elm Hill closed in 1946.</p>
