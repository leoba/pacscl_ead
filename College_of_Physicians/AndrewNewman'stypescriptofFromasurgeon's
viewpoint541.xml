                <p>Founded in 1922 and part of the Shriners Hospitals for Children network,
                    Philadelphia Shriners Hospital is one of 18 orthopedic hospitals throughout
                    North America that provide completely free medical care to children under the
                    age of 18 with orthopedic problems, severe burns and spinal cord injuries. The
                    original hospital, built in 1926, has been replaced by a new building that
                    opened in 1998. The Philadelphia hospital adjoins the Temple University
                    Childrenâ€™s Hospital.</p>
