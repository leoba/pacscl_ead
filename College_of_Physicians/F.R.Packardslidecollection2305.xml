                    resident physician at the Children’s and Pennsylvania Hospitals. In 1895 he
                    began to practice privately and after three years he specialized in diseases of
                    the ear, nose, and throat. He was professor of laryngology and otology at the
                    Philadelphia Polyclinic and College for Graduates in Medicine and was

                    Chestnut Hill Hospitals, the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, the
                    Eastern State Penitentiary, and the State Asylum for the Insane at Norristown.
