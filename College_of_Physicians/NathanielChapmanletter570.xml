            <bioghist>
                <p>Nathaniel Chapman (1780-1853) studied medicine in Philadelphia as a private pupil
                    of Benjamin Rush and later at the Medical School of the University of
                    Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1801. He practiced medicine in
                    Philadelphia for fifty years, but is best known as a medical teacher, editor,
                    and professional advocate. He became editor of the Philadelphia Journal of the
                    Medical and Physical Sciences in 1820, a journal still published today (2000) as
                    the American Journal of the Medical Sciences. From 1810 on he taught at the
                    University of Pennsylvania, serving as professor of materia medica and professor
                    of the theory and practice of medicine and clinical medicine. In 1817 Chapman
                    founded the Medical Institute of Philadelphia, considered the first medical
                    post-graduate school in the United States. Chapman was the first president of
                    the American Medical Association and served as President of the American
                    Philosophical Society. Chapman was also a Fellow of the College of Physicians,
                    elected in 1807.</p>
