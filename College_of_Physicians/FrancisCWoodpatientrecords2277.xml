                <p>Francis Clark Wood was born in South Africa in 1901. Wood received a B.A. from
                    Princeton University in 1922, and an M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in
                    1926. After a residency in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, he
                    began to study cardiology with Charles C. Wolferth and specialized in the
                    development of precordial leads for the electrocardiograph. In 1931, he joined
                    the faculty of the School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. During
                    World War II, Wood was a staff member and, later, Chief of the Medical Services,
                    of the U.S. Army's 20th General Hospital in Assam, India. After the war, he
                    returned to the University of Pennsylvania and was Chairman of the School of
                    Medicine from 1947 to 1965. In 1932, Francis C. Wood became a Fellow of the
                    College of Physicians of Philadelphia and served as its president from 1967 to
                    1969. </p>
