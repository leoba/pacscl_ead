            <bioghist>
                <p>Marianne Craig Moore (1887-1972) was an American poet. She graduated from Bryn
                    Mawr College in 1909 as a biology major and then studied commercial subjects and
                    taught them at the U.S. Indian School in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Her first
                    published work appeared in 1915 in the Egoist and in Harriet Monroe's Poetry
                    magazine. After 1919, living in Brooklyn, New York, with her mother, Moore
                    devoted herself to writing, contributing poetry and criticism to many journals
                    in the United States and England. In 1921 her first book, Poems, was published
                    in London by Hilda Doolittle and Winifred Ellerman (Bryher). In 1925, already
                    well known as one of the leading new poets, she became acting editor of The
                    Dial, an influential American journal of literature and arts, and she remained
                    with The Dial until it was discontinued in 1929. Moore's Collected Poems
                    appeared in 1951. A disciplined craftsman, Moore won the admiration of fellow
                    poets throughout her long career. The poet and critic T.S. Eliot called her one
                    of the few producers of durable poetry in her time.</p>
