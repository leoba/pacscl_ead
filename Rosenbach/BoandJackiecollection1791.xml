                <p>This is a collection of letters from a father to his son, Bo and Jackie,
                    respectively. Bo seems to have lived in Pasadena, California, and Jackie may
                    have lived in the Philadelphia area, but also appears to have traveled
                    extensively. Both appear to have been artists; Bo offered his golf drawings for
                    sale to Harper's [Magazine?] and other publications, and Jackie was a painter,
                    whose works may have been for sale at Stendhal Galleries in Los Angeles, among
                    other outlets. The letters are nearly daily, and discuss the art work of both
                    men, the lives and health of family and friends, woodworking projects (many
                    apparently for painting accessories, such as palettes and easels), cars, and the
                    weather. In many letters, Bo offered advice to Jackie on the subjects,
                    execution, and sale of his artwork.</p>
