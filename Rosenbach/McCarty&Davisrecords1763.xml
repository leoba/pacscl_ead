            <bioghist>
                <p>M'Carty &amp; Davis were early Philadelphia booksellers and publishers. The firm,
                    owned by William McCarty (1788-1861) and Thomas Davis (1790?-1851), was a
                    successor to Johnson &amp; Warner, who were noted for publishing children's
                    books. Jacob Johnson (1771?-1819) and Benjamin Warner (1786-1821) sold their
                    firm in 1815 to McCarty and Davis. In 1831, Moses Polock (1817-1903) was
                    employed by McCarty &amp; Davis as a clerk. Twenty years later Polock acquired
                    the business, and upon his death the firm descended to his nephew, Abraham Simon
                    Wolf Rosenbach (1876-1952).</p>
