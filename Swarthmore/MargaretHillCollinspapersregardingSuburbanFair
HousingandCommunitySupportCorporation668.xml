            <bioghist>
                <p>Margaret Hill Collins (1908-2006) was educated at Sarah Lawrence College and the
                    University of California at Berkeley, and later received a master's degree in
                    social work from Bryn Mawr College. She was a member of Haverford Meeting. In
                    1956, Collins formed Friends Suburban Housing, a real estate agency that worked
                    to integrate housing on the Main Line. In 1963, its name was changed to Suburban
                    Fair Housing (SFH). Collins was executive secretary of the company, which ended
                    operation in 1976 as fair housing laws were strengthened. Later, Collins worked
                    with the Community Support Corporation (CSC) to rehabilitate houses for
                    low-income families. She also produced a three-volume genealogy of the Collins
                    family.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of papers of Margaret Hill Collins related to her work with

                    correspondence, minutes, and financial records of the CSC; documentation of
                    projects performed at individual houses, including estimates, bills and
                    receipts, plans, and bills of sale; drafts of proposals for several cooperative
                    housing initiatives in the early 1950s; typed articles and prayers by Collins;
                    memorial booklets; newspaper clippings; awards and certificates of appreciation;
                    brochures of SFH; and photographs of houses sold through SFH. The collection
                    also includes a small amount of genealogical material and poems and writings of
                    Collins's cousin Hilda Worthington Smith.</p>
