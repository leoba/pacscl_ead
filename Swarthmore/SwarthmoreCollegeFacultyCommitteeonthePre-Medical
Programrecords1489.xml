            <bioghist>
                <p>Swarthmore College's Faculty Committee on the Pre-Medical Program was established
                    in 1949 by President John Nason to provide guidance to pre-medical undergraduate
                    students at Swarthmore and to prepare comprehensive letters of recommendation
                    for those students. The committee also compiled academic statistics on the
                    pre-medical students and tracked their progress in medical school. </p>
