            <bioghist>
                <p>Nelson Fuson (1913-2006) was born in Guangzhou, China, to American Presbyterian
                    missionaries, Chester and Phebe Fuson. Fuson earned his master's in physics and
                    astronomy at Kansas University in 1935 and his Ph.D. in physics at the
                    University of Michigan in 1938. He then worked as an instructor in physics at
                    Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey. Beginning in 1941, as the U.S.
                    became involved in World War II, Fuson served as a conscientious objector in
                    Civilian Public Service (CPS) workcamps at Patapsco, Maryland, Goshen, Indiana,
                    Big Flats, New York, and Trenton, North Dakota. He also attended the
                    experimental Columbia University Training Unit in International Administration,
                    and worked for several months at Pendle Hill, Pennsylvania, directing a CPS
                    China Relief unit (which was blocked by a congressional military appropriations
                    bill rider), and a final year in CPS "detached service" doing infrared
                    research on penicillin at the University of Michigan. After the war, Fuson
                    participated in several international service seminars sponsored by the American
                    Friends Service Committee (AFSC).</p>

            <scopecontent>
                <p>This collection consists of the papers of Nelson Fuson, primarily from the period
                    when he served in the Civilian Public Service (1941 to 1945) and the period
                    following World War II. Materials include: correspondence, reports, newsletters,
                    schedules, meeting minutes, and photographs from various CPS workcamps;

                    Training Unit in International Administration; correspondence and memos from the
                    1943 Chicago Conference on Social Action; addresses, memos, and other writings
                    by Fuson; and programs, reports, correspondence, and photographs from AFSC
                    International Service Seminars from 1946 to 1949. The collection also includes
                    letters to friends from Marian and Nelson Fuson during their sabbatical in
                    France (1956-1959); letters from Nelson Fuson to Marian before and just after
                    their marriage; and a small batch of correspondence with Kate and Eberhard
                    Tacke, a couple the Fusons met during their stay in Europe; etchings and a
                    drawing by Eberhard Tacke; and several civil rights-era phonograph albums and an
                    AFSC anniversary recording.</p>
