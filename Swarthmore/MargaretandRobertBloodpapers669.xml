            <bioghist>
                <p>Margaret Cheek Blood (1918-1999) was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. While attending
                    Yale Divinity School, she became involved in the Society of Friends. She married
                    Robert O. Blood (1921-1988), also a Quaker, in Lexington, Kentucky. During World
                    War II, they worked with Japanese-Americans interned in Arkansas. In 1952 they
                    moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan. Margaret led the First Day School there for many
                    years. She was also involved with the United Nations Associations, Women's
                    Strike for Peace, and the Interfaith Council for Peace. Robert O. Blood was a
                    social science researcher at the University of Michigan. He was the author of
                    several textbooks on marriage and the family. Blood wrote as a social scientist
                    and neither Quakerism nor overt moralism was present in his texts. Together, the
                    Bloods worked at Pendle Hill as co-leaders of workshops on personal growth and
                    creative movement. In 1973 they opened a retreat and counseling center in their
                    home.</p>
