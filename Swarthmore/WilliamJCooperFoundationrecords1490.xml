            <bioghist>
                <p>The William J. Cooper Foundation was established to provide a varied program of
                    lectures, performances and exhibitions which enriches the academic work of
                    Swarthmore College. The Foundation was established by a gift from William J.
                    Cooper (1849-1925). Cooper's wife, Emma McIlvain, was a manager at Swarthmore
                    for many years. Cooper specified that the income from his gift should be used
                    "in bringing to the college eminent citizens of this and other countries who
                    are leaders in statesmanship, education, the arts, sciences, learned professions
                    and business." Past chairmen of the Cooper Foundation have included Willis D.
                    Weatherford, Peter Grams Swing, and Thomas Blackburn.</p>
