            <bioghist>
                <p>Friends Housing, Inc., was formed as an independent non-profit corporation in
                    1966 in response to a petition signed by 100 residents of the Mantua
                    neighborhood in Philadelphia and the concern of the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting,
                    Social Concerns Committee. The Corporation was primarily involved in
                    fund-raising for the rehabilitation of vacant and vandalized properties for low
                    income families. David S. Richie, a Quaker who organized the Weekend Workcamp
                    program of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, served as president of the board of
                    directors. The Board included representatives from the community and members of
                    the Mantua Belmont Joint Committee of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting.</p>
