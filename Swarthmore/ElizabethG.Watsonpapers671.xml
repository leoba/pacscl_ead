            <bioghist>
                <p>Elizabeth Grill Watson (1914-2006) was a freelance writer, speaker, and workshop
                    leader, with particular interests in liberation, feminist, and creation
                    theology. Watson received her bachelor's degree in English literature and Greek
                    from Miami University, and later studied theology at Chicago Theological
                    Seminary and the University of Chicago Divinity School before discovering the
                    Society of Friends and becoming a Quaker. In 1937, she married George Watson.

                    Wisdom's Daughters, a book about women of the New Testament. </p>
