            <bioghist>
                <p>The Commission on Educational Policy was convened in 1966 by President Courtney
                    Smith to study the educational principles and practices at Swarthmore College.
                    The Commission studied Swarthmore's entire academic program, including
                    curriculum, conditions of faculty scholarship, and college organization. Charles
                    E. Gilbert was the Commission's chairman. The results of the Commission's study
                    were published, along with reports by the Special Committee on Library Policy
                    and the Special Committee on Student life, under the title Critique of a College
                    in the fall of 1967.</p>
