            <bioghist>
                <p>To mark the 100th anniversary of Swarthmore's founding, the college established
                    the Centennial Fund campaign of 1963-64. The goal of this campaign was to raise
                    $10,000,000. Thomas B. McCabe was the campaign's chairman and Wolcott D. Street
                    was the campaign director.</p>

                <p>This is a collection of records related to development activities at Swarthmore
                    College. Much of the collection consists of records of the Centennial Fund
                    campaign, including: reports, financial statements, memos, and minutes; appeals
                    to individual and corporate donors; subject files on foundations and
                    corporations; campaign literature for the Centennial Fund and for previous
                    campaigns at Swarthmore; donor lists; administrative and financial records of
                    the campaign office. The collection also contains files from the office of
                    Swarthmore Vice President Joseph B. Shane. These records include: correspondence
                    related to alumni relations and donations; documentation of student activities
                    and policies, such as the alcohol policy, student conduct, and opposition to the
                    draft; and documentation of other college events, including the dedication of
                    McCabe Library.</p>
